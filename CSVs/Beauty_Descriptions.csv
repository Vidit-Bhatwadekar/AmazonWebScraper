Welcome to the world of advanced styling, where curling irons heat up in less than a minute, where you can choose between 25 different temperature settings for any hair type, and where, if left unattended, your curling iron automatically turns off. Conair's 1-inch curling iron is ideal for creating those medium-to-large bouncing curls. Featuring dual voltage settings, the iron allows you to select either standard North American 125-volt or 250-volt foreign electricity operation, so you can use your curler when you're traveling abroad. Its sure-grip handle has a patented design for greater control and precision, and the electronic on/off touch pad is easy to use. If you forget to turn off the curler (too busy fending off your admirers, we assume), it will automatically shut itself off. With that 60-second heat-up time and a flashing indicator light that lets you know when you can start styling, you'll have playful curls to impress within minutes. And with a two-year limited warranty, you'll be curling for years to come. --Ariel Meadow Stallings

147,"Fallene Total Block Clear Sunblock, SPF 65 - 2 Oz

Fallene Total Block Clear SPF 65 is a highly effective sunscreen product formulated with photo-protective and cellular-protective agents that are beneficial to the skin. Total Block is unique in its ability to protect skin from the full light spectrum and prevent cellular environmental damage to the skin, regardless of the source of the pollutants. Incorporating eight forms of mill-dispersed solids -- ranging in controlled particle size from 10 microns down to a few nanometers -- Total Block achieves maximum protection throughout the entire UVB and UVA range. These particles are homogeneously suspended and work to shield the skin from atmospheric damage and trauma. Micronized and sub-micronized particles of titanium dioxide, sub-micronized zinc oxide, and ultra-micronized iron oxide form the foundation of this powerful, effective sunscreen.



The Total Block Clear SPF 65, as well as the other Fallene products, are specially designed for photo-sensitive individuals, but are perfect for anyone concerned about maintaining healthy skin and promoting the integrity of their immune system.

The Dangers of UVB Wavelengths
SPF rating does not adequately measure protection from all the damaging radiation effects of light. SPF is only a determination of protection from one specific wavelength of ultraviolet radiation, the UVB (290nm - 320nm). Unfortunately, there is no currently approved standard to rate the quality of a sunscreen's UVA protective capabilities. UVA (320nm - 400nm) is the deeper penetrating wavelength that is more often associated with skin changes, such as wrinkling, pigmentation, and long term damage. The SPF rating system does not accurately or completely define a sunscreen's protective capabilities from harmful ultraviolet radiation, except the UVB wavelength.

UVB creates a red, painful irritation first experienced during early sun exposure, but UVB is not the only ultraviolet wavelength damaging to the skin. In fact, UVB has only a minimal effect upon the deeper depth of skin. UVB and UVA radiation are both recognized as causing skin cancer, and SPF 30 protection is just not enough.

Direct Physical Photoblockers Benefits
Most of the physical photoblockers are naturally occurring metal compounds (iron, chromium, zinc, titanium, etc), although some, such as bismuth, are man-made. In addition to their photo-protective attributes, these substances also assist in preventing windburns and skin damage from wind-driven micro-particles, such as dirt and grime. These physical blockers also offer a substantial defense against infrared rays in two ways.



Titanium Dioxide: Absorbs Light and Protects Skin
This white-pigment powder is widely used in cosmetics. Products containing large-particle titanium have a greater opacity, which means they have greater lightening or whitening qualities. Opaque titanium dioxide is highly reflective and strongly scatters all UV and visible rays. It also reflects much of the skin-damaging infrared waves, keeping skin cooler and reducing ""heat"" damage that causes unwanted photo-aging.

To photo-stabilize titanium dioxide it must be micro-coated with a protectant, such as silicone or aluminum oxide. Since titanium dioxide spreads poorly on the skin, another way to inhibit its breakdown is to incorporate titanium dioxide with other blockers. To achieve cosmetic elegance and usefulness, microcoating the titanium dioxide assures a good, even application to the skin. A downside of large-particle titanium dioxide products is that they produce a white, opaque appearance on the skin when applied. However, submicronizing the titanium dioxide powder, as Fallene does, creates small particles that absorb visible light and protect the skin, but they're still invisible on the skin, so you're not covered in embarrassing white salve.

Transparent (sub-micronized) titanium dioxide works by absorbing, reflecting and scattering UVB and some UVA rays. However, protection against UV, visible and infrared is significantly limited when submicronized titanium dioxide is the primary protectant.

Zinc Oxide: Extends Photo-Protection
Zinc Oxide has been known and used topically for centuries as a skin protectant and wound-healing adjuvant and is also recognized as a mild antimicrobial agent. More than 50 years ago, zinc oxide was indicated as a block for ultraviolet light (UVB/UVA). It also reflects infrared from the skin, as does titanium dioxide. However, its ability to protect in the long UVA range (300nn - 400nm) is much higher than titanium dioxide. Zinc oxide absorbs, rather than scatters, most UVA, while titanium dioxide primarily scatters these wavelengths. Thus, formulated in combination with titanium dioxide, ultra-fine zinc oxide ""closes the window"" in the UVA range. Zinc oxide works to both complement titanium dioxide's protection and extend photo-protection to the skin where titanium dioxide is insufficient. The optimal particle size range for ultraviolet blocking zinc oxide (without blocking visible wavelengths) is approximately 80 to 150 nanometers (1,000 nanometers = 1 micron).

Iron Oxides: Adds Color and Complements Primary UV Blocking Agents
Iron oxide is used in a wide array of cosmetics to provide cover-up color. Cosmetic iron oxides are manufactured to a high purity, desired color and particle size.

Iron oxide pigments for cosmetic use are micronized powders. They are available in a number of shades and tones of red, yellow, black and brown. These cosmetic pigments, if incorporated at adequate concentration and properly dispersed, not only add color, but they also provide significant skin protection from multiple wavelengths of light.

Ultra-submicronized iron oxides protect against visible light waves, but also add a little color to the finished product. This allows for the addition of higher levels of infrared protecting iron oxides, while retaining the cosmetic elegance and shade of the final preparation. Submicronized iron oxides block ultraviolet rays, which is a great complement to the primary UV blocking agents.

Nonstick ceramic surface glides across hair! Static-free. Professional high heat levels. Heat-resistant shield fits securely over hot barrel for use while the iron is heating up for added convenience. Ceramic technology! Ceramic-coated iron glides through hair easily; distributes heat evenly for silky-smooth, maximum professional styling results at home; Uniform Heat Recovery System for consistent curls. Every time you curl, heat transfers from the barrel to your hair, reducing the barrel temperature. This feature automatically restores the barrel temperature to the optimum level, curl after curl; 60 Second Instant Heat-Up; 30 Variable temperature settings for every hair type; Protective heat shield; On/Off tough-pad; Power indicator light; Worldwide dual voltage; Cool tip; Auto Off; Stand; 6-Foot Tangle-free swivel cord. UL Listed. Limited 2 Year Warranty.

If you were around in the 70s, the words ""curling iron"" may bring back haunting memories of big complicated hairdos and Farrah-Fawcett wings. But times have changed and curling irons are now low-fuss and gentler on hair than they were in the past. This Satin Finish model has a ceramic-coated barrel, which distributes heat evenly without creating frizz or hair damage like the curling irons of the earlier years. The ceramic technology also prevents the curling iron from sticking to hair and even promotes silky, shiny hair.

For quick styling, the Satin Finish instantly heats up 60 seconds after powering up and offers 30 different heat settings on its adjustable dial to accommodate all hair types. To create consistently perfect curls, the curling iron employs a feature called the Uniform Heat Recovery System. This system transfers heat from the barrel to hair during curling, causing the barrel to cool down slightly, and then resumes its former temperature before you curl the next section of hair.

The 1-inch barrel on this curling iron is an all-purpose size that can curl hair under, flip ends up, or create wider ringlets or free-flowing curls. For safety, this curling appliance has a heat-resistant shield that slides over the barrel while its heating up or for storage. Other safety precautions include a cool tip on the end of the barrel; a built-in stand to raise the curler off the countertop; a power light; and a 6-inch tangle-free, swiveling cord. Conair provides a two-year limited warranty on its Satin Finish curling irons. --Cristina Vaamonde

196,"Natrol Promensil Menopausal Relief Tablets are a dietary supplement of plant estrogens extracted from red clover which provide natural relief for menopausal symptoms and more. Natrol Promensil products balance your hormones so you can stay in control. These tablets relieve hot flashes, night sweats, promote breast and heart health, and promote emotional well being. They are clinically proven & doctor recommended. Why do women around the world use Promensil? Clinical research has shown that in cultures consuming a diet abundant in isoflavones women have fewer and milder menopausal symptoms. Promensil's active ingredients are Red Clover isoflavones, which complement the body's declining estrogen levels, so relieving menopausal symptoms. Natrol makes this product in the U.S.A.!



A dietary supplement of plant estrogens extracted from red clover. 

Promensil Key Facts:

Manage midlife as nature intended with the most complete source of plant estrogens.

There is mounting scientific evidence that isoflavone plant estrogens supplement the body's own decreasing estrogen supply and provide relief from the symptoms associated with midlife.* 

The typical American diet provides only 5 mg of these plant estrogens a day - one-eight the the amount in Asian, Latin American, and Mediterranean cultures where women suffer fewer midlife symptoms.*

Promensil makes up the difference by providing 40mg of plant estrogens in one convenient daily tablet. Derived from red clover, one of nature's richest sources, Promensil is the only supplement that delivers the four major dietary plant estrogens - genistein, biochanin, daidzen and formononetin. Some sources like soy contain only two.

Promensil is clinically proven to reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats without the worry of weight gain. Promensil also maintains bone health and lets a woman feel like herself again by promoting emotional well-being.*

Promensil is particularly recommended as a dietary supplement for women interested in replenishing and maintaining healthy estrogen levels to preserve physical and emotional well-being before and during midlife.*

Midlife as Nature Intended.

Promensil is free of yeast, milk derivatives, wheat, cornstarch, gluten, preservatives, artificial colors and artificial flavors. No sugar added.

That's why Women's ROGAINE is the number-one dermatologist-recommended brand for hair regrowth. Make ROGAINE part of your everyday beauty regimen and feel proud of your hair again.



The Hair Growth Process: What Causes Hair Loss?
Did you know the average woman is born with about 100,000 hair follicles on her head--and she keeps them for the rest of her life? Most women lose between 50 and 100 hairs a day. If your hair is healthy, it will grow back on its own. But if you're one of the 30 million women in America who experience hereditary hair loss, you may be losing 150 hairs or more a day--hair that doesn't grow back as thick and healthy as it once was.

You may notice more hair on your brush, in your sink, or in the shower drain. As your hair begins to look thinner, it may become a challenge to style. The good news is, with ROGAINE, you can take control of hair loss and start regrowing beautiful, healthy hair--especially if you begin treatment at the very first signs of hair loss.

Use Styling Products with ROGAINE? Sure!
Using ROGAINE doesn't mean giving up your favorite styling products. So spray away. Gel it up and/or mousse around. Just make sure your styling aids don't interfere with letting ROGAINE become absorbed into your scalp. Always remember to wait until ROGAINE dries before you use your styling aids, and be sure to apply styling aids to your hair--not to your scalp.

Waiting for ROGAINE to dry shouldn't slow you down one bit. Many women multitask. They apply ROGAINE and then, while ROGAINE dries, they put on makeup, have breakfast, or answer e-mail before they style their hair.

A Pioneer in Hair Regrowth
Like many great discoveries, the power of minoxidil to regrow hair came about by chance. In the 1980s, scientists discovered that minoxidil, being studied for other indications, actually showed signs of regrowing hair.

ROGAINE applied this discovery to produce the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair. Since then, ROGAINE has empowered millions of people to take control of their hair loss with a series of breakthroughs.

About ROGAINE: A History of Results and Innovation
ROGAINE is the first topical brand approved by the FDA to regrow hair--in both women and men. With more than 20 years of results and over 20,000 people in clinical trials, ROGAINE is the #1 dermatologist-recommended brand for hair regrowth. ROGAINE helps reverse the progression of hereditary hair loss.

The Natural Instincts system is the healthier hair color indulgence—a non-permanent, ammonia-free formula with aloe, vitamin and antioxidants.

In most cases, this process is amplified when you color your hair. Our Natural Instincts system nourishes and protects your hair with clinically proven healthier color. The antioxidant properties prevent the formation of highly reactive, damaging molecules by helping to inactivate the metal ions that cause their formation. This leads to predictable color results and hair that’s actually healthier-looking than before you colored.

Less guilt. More gorgeous. A perfect recipe for clinically proven healthier color.1 The Natural Instincts system has aloe, vitamin and antioxidants. Plus even more reasons to make the switch:

The normal skin barrier function, which protects and conditions the skins' surface, originates from a special structure composed of lamellar lipid layers. The patented MLE formula, which includes plant derived ingredients, mimics the natural structure of the lipid layers found in the skin. These layers play an important role in moisturizing and maintaining the skin barrier. The very dry, sensitive and damaged skin conditions targeted by ATOPALM MLE products, are as a result of an abnormal lamellar structure due to the skin layers being deficient in ceramide and fatty acids. Because Multi Lamellar Emulsion, is very similar to the structure and composition of those all important lipid layers in the stratum corneum, it is ideally compatible with the skin and can help reinforce the skin barrier function while helping to soothe, calm and nourish dry, damaged skin. The unique and patented MLE formula of plant derived ingredients, mimics the structure of the natural skin lipids and aids in the replenishment of those natural skin lipids in the stratum corneum and in the restoration of the skin's protective barrier. It also helps prevent the over evaporation of the skins' own moisture and protects it from the stresses of the environment. And, it aids in restoring the skin barrier depleted by micro dermabrasion and other harsh treatments.

529,"New! The Panasonic Pore Cleanser with Mist cleans deep below the surface for clear, beautiful skin. The latest innovation from Panasonic features a micro-fine mist that sprays as you clean. The mist allows for better suction and smoother use on the skin while cleansing your pores. Continuous micro-fine mist ensures that the suction cup stays on your skin tightly to remove oil and dirt from the pores. Without it, gaps of air form between the suction cup and the skin resulting in a loss of suction force. Now a continuous spray of fine mist seals the surface and enhances suction power for cleaner pores plus alleviates potential skin irritation resulting from pulling action on the skin. This Pore Cleanser can be used in a wet or dry environment and can be fully immersed in water. Using the Pore Cleanser during or after the shower allows your pores to open up and improves cleaning effectiveness.The reversible suction cup is great for targeting specific areas of the face. The ultra slim design allows the suction cup to focus in on hard-to-reach areas around the nose. Simply reverse the suction cup to cover larger areas of your skin. The Pore Cleanser with Mist from Panasonic cleanses away whiteheads and blackheads as well as refines the appearance of large pores. It provides a refreshing, clean sensation while keeping dirt and oil out of your pores. Once you begin using the Pore Cleanser regularly, you'll be on your way to cleaner, clearer skin.

Achieve straight, shiny hair with the Remington Wet2Straight Straightening Iron. Used on wet or dry hair, the Wet2Straight delivers professional salon results from home, and it features variable temperature settings for all hair types. This fast-working straightener heats up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and vaporizes any excess water left over after towel-drying, saving you the extra time it takes to blow-dry your hair before straightening wet hair.

Dry and Style with Steam Hydration Therapy
Remington's Wet2Straight styling tool allows you to straighten your hair while it's still wet. Heating up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, the Wet2Straight's 2-inch wide plates vaporize excess water as they glide down the hair, releasing steam through specially designed holes in the straightener. The steam emits a slight hissing sound as it escapes, letting you know the process is working.

Steam hydration therapy protects your hair from over-drying during this process by keeping the right amount of moisture locked in, ensuring that your hair stays healthy and sleek. This not only saves you the time of having to blow-dry before straightening, but also is better for your hair.

Dial in Temperature for Any Hair Type
The Wet2Straight lets you choose the right amount of heat for your hair type thanks to variable heat control ranging from 300 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. An easy-to-read digital display shows you exactly how much heat you're using, while a temperature lock prevents you from accidentally changing the setting. For a short, sharp burst of extra heat, hit the turbo boost.

Wide 2-inch plates make getting to the root a cinch, and the long plate length lets you straighten wider sections of hair, saving you time. The Wet2Straight heats up in 30 seconds, and features an auto shutoff after 60 minutes.

Low heat settings are advisable for people with colored, bleached, or fine hair. Those with normal hair should opt for mid-range temperatures, while those with coarse or thick hair can crank it up to the maximum heat setting.

Remington has been helping the world get ready for over 70 years. Experts in innovation, they offer cutting-edge technology and work with top salon professionals from all over the world to produce hair styling products that really work. Remington's mission is to help you look good and feel like you're ready for anything, so you can look in the mirror and say, ""Okay, world, here I come.""

The amazing properties of shea butter

Shea butter is the best natural product to protect, heal and improve skin. It is prized because it contains a real cocktail of elements that are good for the skin. Among these, is first a very high content of essential fatty acids, more than in all other vegetable butter’s. These fatty acids are oleic, stearic, linoleic and palmitic acid. They play a very important moisturizing, softening, and anti-inflammatory role, and help renew the cutaneous cells.

Why it’s great for your skin

Shea butter also contains vitamins A, D, E, and K which have a recognized effect against skin aging. It is also rich in phytosterols with protecting and regenerating virtues.

Product advice

The shelf life of shea butter is 18-24 months when kept in a cool dry place. After that time the healing properties of shea butter are less effective but it will still make a good moisturizer.

Perfectly sized

Each cup contains 8oz of unrefined, filtered shea butter that is 100% free from impurities. It is an ideal product to carry in your purse or handbag and is ideal for vacations and business trips. Keeping a small pot in your glove compartment or office drawer ensures you always have some soothing and healing shea butter to hand, whatever the eventualities.

940,"Mason Pearson Combs are manufactured in Switzerland by a contract manufacturing facility that ONLY makes combs. The same, strict, quality control standards followed in our brush making are applied to our combs. Mason Pearson combs are Hand Made from the finest celluloid material in the world. This is the same material used to make designer costume jewelry, hair ornaments, and eyewear. Look carefully at the “tortoise” pattern of our combs. You will notice, the “3D’ effect of the “shell” pattern. This is the result of an internationally patented process that replicates natural tortoise shell. The “plastic” comes to the factory in Switzerland from Italy in a sheet, where it is die-cut into general the general shapes of the comb styles. From that point, until the comb is finished, everything is done by hand. Each tooth is cut, one at a time, on a special saw. The comb is then tumbled in a polishing drum to smooth the surface. The next step is hand polishing to remove all burrs, sharp edges, and surface imperfections. Finally, it is buffed to create the high gloss finish.

1125,"According to most research dermatologists, serious dark circles (the kind that make you look old, tired, and exhausted) are about the oxidation of hemoglobin (blood) in the capillary matrix of the peri-orbital eye area. These capillaries actually ""leak"" blood that begins to oxidize (through a process called hemoglobin degradation), creating a dark bluish-red pigmentation that looks distinctly like an ugly bruise. In scientific studies, Hylexin has been shown to help reduce hemoglobin degradation byproducts by optimizing enzymatic activity, causing the red-blue pigmentation to fade. Studies also confirm that Hylexin actually helps strengthen the capillary matrix to help stop the ""leaking,"" so your orbital eye area is protected against further damage. In a double-blind clinical trial more than 72% of women who had serious dark circles and used Hylexin's key compound saw an obvious, tangible, visible reduction in the color and severity of their dark circles. These results were confirmed with high-speed laboratory photography that clearly showed a significant reduction in the appearance of the blue and red color that makes dark eye circles so noticeable and so unattractive.

1243,"Regenerist targeted tone enhancer was launched by the design house of olay. It is recommended for normal skin.

Renew the outer layer of your skin for a more youthful glow. Regenerist Targeted Tone Enhancer uses an exclusive amino-peptide complex combined with pro-retinol to renew the outer layer of your skin for a more youthful brightness. It allows you to target damaged cells by diminishing the appearance of age spots and discoloration without drastic measures.** The results? Beautifully regenerated skin - the appearance of age spots and discoloration diminished. **Results not equal to medical procedures. Dermatologist and ophthalmologist tested. Non-comedogenic (won't clog pores). Oil free. Color free. Fragrance free.











Peptides have long been known to play a vital role in the skin's natural healing process. Olay Regenerist combines these compounds with essential vitamins in a moisturizing Peptide-B3 Complex to regenerate the skin's appearance without irritation. This patented formula works within the skin's surface to improve its appearance by maintaining the moisture barrier while speeding the natural regeneration process to reveal newer, younger-looking skin.

Some of the most effective anti-aging products and procedures, such as dermabrasion and chemical peels, may irritate the skin while removing old cells and stimulate the regrowth of younger-looking skin. However, this irritation and resulting moisture barrier damage can leave the skin vulnerable to environmental insults, such as exposure to sun or chemicals.

While results are not equal, Olay Regenerist works without irritation to regenerate the skin's appearance with visible anti-aging results and maintain a healthy moisture barrier. The moisture barrier is critical to keeping your skin hydrated, healthy and protected. This ability to maintain the barrier function is essential for a highly effective anti-aging product, especially for those who can't tolerate the harsher, irritating products and procedures currently available.

A study also showed that women who used Regenerist Serum with Peptide-B3 Complex experienced significantly increased exfoliation for renewal of the skin's outer layer. With its unique complex the Serum revealed newer skin cells at the surface more than twice as fast as untreated skin and 20% faster than the non-Peptide-B3 Complex product!

1296,"Absolute bliss. Pure, moisturizing Savon de Marseille soaps with the regional flowers of lavender, orange, rose and verbena. In the Middle Ages, big blocks of gentle soap were first crafted in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille with olive oil from local groves, marine ash and sea salted water. The quality of these soaps were immediately famous throughout Europe and in 1688 French law declared that only soaps made according to certain ancient methods could bear the important mark Savon de Marseille. Now the most prized of all soaps in the world, our Savon de Marseille is still crafted by hand, in Marseille, just as it has been for hundreds of years. It takes the Maitre de Savon (soapmaster) two weeks to make Marseille Soap. The purest ingredients (mentioned above) are heated for ten days in antique cauldrons. Know-how passed down through the generations will reveal to the soapmaster the right moment to pour the mixture into open pits where it slowly hardens. Cut into cubes and stamped, without machines of any kind, the soaps are then set out to dry in the sun and cool winds. Savon de Marseille (also known as ""Marseille Soap"") is once again being rediscovered for its extraordinary purity, gentle skin care and ecological value. Savon de Marseille is recommended by dermatologists throughout the world for dry or sensitive skin, eczema and other ailments. In France it has been trusted for generations to cleanse everything from linens to little faces. Marseille Soap is totally biodegradable, requires little packaging and its manufacture is environmentally friendly. Authentic Marseille Soap is stamped with its weight in grams - allowing households to compare prices and plan their inventories. No soap is ""greener."" In France they are sold piled high on open-air market tables like produce, wrapped in craft paper. Your Savon de Marseille will be delivered without plastic packaging, carefully wrapped in paper stamped with the famous marks to prove its authenticity. FSL

1446,"The Argan Tree, Argania spinosa from Sapotaceae family and grows only in Morocco. The trees can live from 150-200 years. For centuries traditional cosmetic products produced from Argania spinosa have been a well kept secret known only to Berber women in Morocco. Argan oil is believed to be one of the rarest oils in the world. To produce Argan oil for cosmetic use, freshly harvested kernels from the fruit of the Argan tree are pressed and filtered through an organic cotton sieve, to extract the aromatic oil. The Argan oil is easily absorbed by the skin. This form of Argan oil is used for the treatment of dermatologic disease (acne, etc). Argan oil extracted by this method is used in Aromatherapy. In Europe, Argan oil has been used in the Aromatherapy industry for a long time, but for some reason it is not well known in the United States and is unavailable in retail stores. Argan oil has almost twice as much vitamin E or a-tocopherol as olive oil and it is much richer in linoleic acids. Its anti-ageing properties, due to high levels of vitamin E and saponins (which soften the skin), are well documented. Tocopherols are very important to human health because of their anti-oxidant actions and free radical scavenger affects. In traditional Moroccan medicine, Argan oil is used for the care of the body and face to counteract the effects of age or weather.

1449,"One 2.5-ounce tube of SPF58 sunscreen. Contains only titanium and zinc. Extra gentle; dermatologist recommended for sensitive skin.

Fallene Cotz SPF 58 is a mineral-based sunscreen that utilizes ultra-micronized titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and iron oxide for effective protection from the sun's harmful rays. Cotz is dye-, oil-, PABA- and fragrance-free, offering full-spectrum protection without any ""chemical sunscreen"" ingredients. This product is ideal for light-sensitive and pediatric uses, but it is also an excellent sunscreen choice for just about anyone with sensitive skin. In addition, this sunscreen offers significant water-resistant properties, which makes it an ideal choice for active people and outdoor activities. Cotz SPF 58 will leave your skin soft, smooth, and, most importantly, protected from harmful UVA and UVB rays.



The Cotz SPF 58, as well as the other Fallene products, are specially designed for photo-sensitive individuals, but are perfect for anyone concerned about maintaining healthy skin and promoting the integrity of their immune system.

The Dangers of UVB Wavelengths
SPF rating does not adequately measure protection from all the damaging radiation effects of light. SPF is only a determination of protection from one specific wavelength of ultraviolet radiation, the UVB (290nm - 320nm). Unfortunately, there is no currently approved standard to rate the quality of a sunscreen's UVA protective capabilities. UVA (320nm - 400nm) is the deeper penetrating wavelength that is more often associated with skin changes, such as wrinkling, pigmentation, and long term damage. The SPF rating system does not accurately or completely define a sunscreen's protective capabilities from harmful ultraviolet radiation, except the UVB wavelength.

UVB creates a red, painful irritation first experienced during early sun exposure, but UVB is not the only ultraviolet wavelength damaging to the skin. In fact, UVB has only a minimal effect upon the deeper depth of skin. UVB and UVA radiation are both recognized as causing skin cancer, and SPF 30 protection is just not enough.

Direct Physical Photoblockers Benefits
Most of the physical photoblockers are naturally occurring metal compounds (iron, chromium, zinc, titanium, etc), although some, such as bismuth, are man-made. In addition to their photo-protective attributes, these substances also assist in preventing windburns and skin damage from wind-driven micro-particles, such as dirt and grime. These physical blockers also offer a substantial defense against infrared rays in two ways.



Titanium Dioxide: Absorbs Light and Protects Skin
This white-pigment powder is widely used in cosmetics. Products containing large-particle titanium have a greater opacity, which means they have greater lightening or whitening qualities. Opaque titanium dioxide is highly reflective and strongly scatters all UV and visible rays. It also reflects much of the skin-damaging infrared waves, keeping skin cooler and reducing ""heat"" damage that causes unwanted photo-aging.

To photo-stabilize titanium dioxide it must be micro-coated with a protectant, such as silicone or aluminum oxide. Since titanium dioxide spreads poorly on the skin, another way to inhibit its breakdown is to incorporate titanium dioxide with other blockers. To achieve cosmetic elegance and usefulness, microcoating the titanium dioxide assures a good, even application to the skin. A downside of large-particle titanium dioxide products is that they produce a white, opaque appearance on the skin when applied. However, submicronizing the titanium dioxide powder, as Fallene does, creates small particles that absorb visible light and protect the skin, but they're still invisible on the skin, so you're not covered in embarrassing white salve.

Transparent (sub-micronized) titanium dioxide works by absorbing, reflecting and scattering UVB and some UVA rays. However, protection against UV, visible and infrared is significantly limited when submicronized titanium dioxide is the primary protectant.

Zinc Oxide: Extends Photo-Protection
Zinc Oxide has been known and used topically for centuries as a skin protectant and wound-healing adjuvant and is also recognized as a mild antimicrobial agent. More than 50 years ago, zinc oxide was indicated as a block for ultraviolet light (UVB/UVA). It also reflects infrared from the skin, as does titanium dioxide. However, its ability to protect in the long UVA range (300nn - 400nm) is much higher than titanium dioxide. Zinc oxide absorbs, rather than scatters, most UVA, while titanium dioxide primarily scatters these wavelengths. Thus, formulated in combination with titanium dioxide, ultra-fine zinc oxide ""closes the window"" in the UVA range. Zinc oxide works to both complement titanium dioxide's protection and extend photo-protection to the skin where titanium dioxide is insufficient. The optimal particle size range for ultraviolet blocking zinc oxide (without blocking visible wavelengths) is approximately 80 to 150 nanometers (1,000 nanometers = 1 micron).

Iron Oxides: Adds Color and Complements Primary UV Blocking Agents
Iron oxide is used in a wide array of cosmetics to provide cover-up color. Cosmetic iron oxides are manufactured to a high purity, desired color and particle size.

Iron oxide pigments for cosmetic use are micronized powders. They are available in a number of shades and tones of red, yellow, black and brown. These cosmetic pigments, if incorporated at adequate concentration and properly dispersed, not only add color, but they also provide significant skin protection from multiple wavelengths of light.

Ultra-submicronized iron oxides protect against visible light waves, but also add a little color to the finished product. This allows for the addition of higher levels of infrared protecting iron oxides, while retaining the cosmetic elegance and shade of the final preparation. Submicronized iron oxides block ultraviolet rays, which is a great complement to the primary UV blocking agents.

Light passes through the surface and interacts with melanin and hemoglobin, ultimately reflecting off the collagen layer, a.k.a the “collagen mirror.” A healthy collagen mirror is smooth and uniform, creating a surface that reflects light back to the surface in the form of healthy-looking luminosity.

In fact, for treating acne pimples, it's the most scientifically advanced and effective device available without a prescription. Zeno is for people with mild to moderate inflammatory acne.

Zeno is a hand-held battery-operated device designed with a tip that heats to a pre-set temperature. The biocompatible tip is designed for direct contact with a blemish on the skin. Once in contact with a blemish, the tip will transfer heat into the follicle. An internal PID controller chip continually modulates the temperature to a fixed range even under different skin and circulation conditions by adjusting the flow of energy to match precisely the heat absorption of the individual user. Zenos microprocessor adapts not only to your individual skin type but also to the heat absorption characteristics of the location of the pimple. Your Zeno adapts to you! An integral digital timer controls the treatment time. The level of heat does not cause skin damage.

Specifically, Zeno stimulates a heat-shock response in p. acnes, the bacteria causing at least 90% of all acne blemishes. Heat shock proteins, activated by bacterial cells under heat stress, cause the self-destruction of p. acnes within the lesion, reducing inflammation and allowing the skin to return to a healthy state.

What is Zeno?

Zeno is a handheld, portable electronic medical device that is clinically proven to make pimples disappear fast. In fact, for treating acne pimples, it's the most scientifically advanced and effective device available without a prescription.

What does it do?

Zeno applies a precisely controlled heat dose directly to the pimple through a metal pad. One treatment lasts 2½ minutes. Two to three treatments spread over 24 hours clear up most pimples quickly. It's that simple.

How does it work?

Pimples occur when excess skin oil and flaking skin plug the opening of a hair follicle and create the ideal environment for acne bacteria to grow. Precisely controlled heat applied for a specific period of time causes the bacteria to self-destruct. When the bacteria die, the pimple goes away.

How many treatments does it take?

Two to three 2½-minute treatments spread over 24 hours are sufficient for most pimples. Often, only one treatment is needed.

Who should use Zeno?

Zeno is for people with mild to moderate inflammatory acne. If in doubt, ask your doctor.

When should Zeno be used?

Use Zeno at the first sign of a pimple. It works best when used on a pimple in the early stages of development. Also, the sooner pimples are cleared up, the less chance they have to leave scars.

How does Zeno compare with topical or oral treatments?

Zeno can clear up a pimple in just hours. Most other medications can take days or even weeks to work. What's more, other than slight, temporary skin redness, Zeno has none of the side effects described by most topical or oral medications.

Is Zeno safe and painless?

Patients included in our clinical trials experienced little reaction to the low-level heat. Other than some temporary skin redness following a treatment cycle, no other adverse side effects were reported. But should you experience any discomfort when using Zeno, discontinue use and consult your skin care professional.

Is Zeno all I need for acne?

Zeno does not replace good skin hygiene or a doctor's care. It is designed to treat mild to moderate inflammatory acne. Your doctor may recommend other therapies, depending on the severity of your acne. Follow your doctor's advice and use Zeno for the occasional pimple.



"
1584,"Zeno relies on carefully controlled heat doses in order to kill P. acnes bacteria.  After multiple cycles of heating and cooling, treatment tips can degrade and become unable to reach sufficient temperature, reducing the efficacy of Zeno's therapy. Zeno's Treatment Tips are therefore limited in the number of treatment cycles they allow so as to ensure that the thermal efficiency cannot degrade to the point of preventing adequate treatment temperature.

1657,"Our founding goal was to develop a product that would naturally hydrate the skin while restoring the protective qualities of the outer layer of skin that modern life strips away. The result was a lotion so different from any previous skin care product that doctors adopted a new name for it: Shielding Lotion. It took 6 years of collaboration between noted dermatologist and surgeons and a world-class chemist (who had created well over 30,000 skin care formulations for the world’s leading cosmetic companies) to reach and then exceed the original goal. The humectant in Skin MD, for example, draws 6 times more moisture into the skin than doe’s glycerin (the previous goal standard and still the most common humectant). Clinical studies by an independent testing laboratory measuring moisture loss demonstrated conclusively that Skin MD Natural actually increases the amount of moisture in the skin over time when compared to all other skin care products (including petrolatum and mineral oil). More importantly, thousands of users have told us that Skin MD Shielding Lotion is the best face & body lotion they have ever used. Even women with severe dry skin conditions and allergies have found relief. Shielding Lotion moisturizes and protects so well it actually prevents dry skin.

That's where our lash primer comes in. blinc lash primer was developed with two objectives in mind, lash/eyebrow treatment and eyelash enhancement. Whether your lashes are tiny and require a larger base with which to work or you are simply looking for incredible volume and length, blinc lash primer is the solution. Developed by blinc to complement the blinc mascara, our lash primer provides a greater base of volume & length for your lashes, prior to applying your mascara. blinc lash primer is dye-free and does not contain any fumes or fragrances that will sting or irritate your eyes. It contains anti-inflammatory and healing agents to soothe and enhance the strength of your lashes/eyebrows while increasing their resistance to breakage. blinc lash primer is also enriched with Vitamin E which nourish by replenishing and augmenting the level of Vitamin B5 in your lashes/eyebrows. Together, your lashes/eyebrows are protected from damage caused by over-heating and/or over-drying, free radicals caused by the natural body process and environmental stresses like ultra-violet light. blinc lash primer imparts long lasting moisture, conditioning your lashes/eyebrows without any build-up. But that's not all: as additional coats are applied, the ingredients work together to build up a greater base of volume, allowing even people with barely-there lashes to notice an enormous difference. Best of all, blinc lash primer does not require any eye makeup remover. Like all blinc products, simply use warm water and gentle pressure for removal.

1826,"The revolutionary product that made Dr. Dennis Gross famous, this two-step, at-home peel in ready-to-use pads delivers both immediate results and long-term benefits. The patented system provides a precise blend of alpha and beta hydroxy acids to improve skin tone, texture, and clarity, plus moisturizers, green tea extract, and antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E to leave skin soothed, balanced, protected.

The MD Skincare® Alpha Beta® Daily Face Peel (Boxed Packettes, 30 Applications) is an innovative, anti-aging skincare system that promotes healthy, youthful skin. Devised by renowned dermatologist Dr. Dennis Gross, the formula uses a gentle combination of alpha and beta hydroxy acids to treat wrinkles, breakouts, and other complexion problems. A simple two-step regimen, it comes with enough pads to last 30 days, each wrapped in a convenient packette to allow for on-the-go use.



Daily Two-Step System for Easy Maintenance
Much like practicing daily exercise is more beneficial than seeing a personal trainer once a month, treating your skin on a daily basis is more beneficial than relying on an occasional visit to your dermatologist. Significant, lasting improvement in skin quality can only be achieved through daily treatment. For this reason, the MD Skincare® Alpha Beta® regimen calls for daily use. Best results are delivered when the system is used consistently.

The system comes with soaked cotton pads, which offer an effective delivery method for the formula and make application easy. To use the system, simply follow two basic steps: first apply a step one alpha-beta pad, let it dry, and then follow up with a step two neutralizing formula pad. The total process takes up only two minutes of your time--a small price for renewed skin quality.

Younger, Clearer, and Healthier Skin
Thanks to its retinol agent, the Alpha Beta® system can provide users with anti-aging effects, ensuring that your skin remains beautiful as you get older. Designed to fit all skin types and ages, this system not only diminishes the appearance of wrinkles, but also balances oil, fights acne breakouts, and promotes a glowing complexion. The formula works to treat and reduce large pores, and helps calm redness and flushness in skin.

Potent but Gentle Formula Renews and Cleanses Skin
The Alpha Beta® system uses a carefully engineered mixture of organic chemicals to deliver the best possible results. Treatment is broken into two steps: alpha-beta refining and enriched neutralizing.

Description: Tamanu Oil (the sacred oil of Tahiti) has gained the world's attention due to a combination of effective use in traditional settings and scientific research supporting its traditional uses. Natural Styles produces and sells only pure, unadulterated Tamanu Oil. Tamanu Oil has anti-inflammatory activity. This activity is due partly to the 4-phenyl coumarin calophyllolide (Bhalla, T.N. et al. Calophyllolide: a new anti-inflammatory agent. Indian J. Med. Res. November, 1980; 72: 762-5) and a group of xanthones in the oil. All the xanthones in tamanu Oil show anti-inflammatory activity, which makes it effective for rashes, sores, swellings and abrasions. Tamanu Oil also possesses a unique capacity to promote the formation of new tissue, thereby accelerating wound healing and the growth of healthy skin. This process is known as cicatrization. For this reason, it is a widely used traditional topical aid and can also be used for burns. Apply a few drops of Tamanu Oil to the skin with your fingers. Very little Tamanu Oil is needed as it takes just a few drops to cover the affected skin area. Gently rub it into your skin. It penetrates very quickly to the lower skin layers and leaves no oily shine.

The perfumer Daniela Roche-Andrier created the composition in four basic accords : Amber – the main accord, rich and complex oriental base which includes amber, vanilla, labdanum, Tonka and patchouli; Fougere – or the aromatic accord with a remarkable soapy note, includes notes of pelargonium, vetiver, orange blossom and myrrh at the heart; Cologne – the refreshing citrusy top of bergamot, mandarin, neroli and cardamom; Leather – leather note is present at the base of the composition ( leather, saffron and sandalwood). Miuccia Prada, the granddaughter of the founder, who turned grandfather’s leather goods design into a large company, personally took part in creating of this perfume. “""I just tried to imagine what I would like if I were a man. ” Maybe due to the fact that it was created by a female hand, the fragrance is not aggressive at all, like it might have been expected from an oriental fragrance with leather and amber. Instead, it is very elegant and masculine gentle. Prada Amber Pour Homme (Prada Man) was created by Daniela (Roche) Andrier and Miuccia Prada. This product is manufactured in Spain.

Glycolic Acid is a superficial peeling agent that is made from sugar cane. It is often considered the most active and beneficial of the Alpha-Hydroxy-Acids (AHA).

Glycolic/35 works beneath the skin to stimulate collagen and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

Working below the surface there is generally very little visible peeling with the Glycolic/35.

With repetitive and continuous use, improvement to skin tone and texture occurs.

Once inside the skin's cell, glycolic acid will serve as a catalyst for the formation of new collagen which will reduce the appearance of wrinkles on the skin's surface.

Glycolic acid has been proven to be very effective in the treatment of hyperpigmentation, melasma, actinic keratosis, acne, and oily skin, as well as other cosmetic uses.

2329,"Elasticity Belly Oil is a luxurious blend of medically researched ingredients that helps protect against stretchmarks. Lavender and sweet almond oil soothe and calm the senses, while nourishing and moisturizing to help skin stretch without damage. Features Vitamin E and Gotu Kola extract.

Belli Elasticity Belly Oil offers a luxurious blend of ingredients that nourish your skin while protecting against stretch marks. This product features Gotu Kola extract, Vitamin E, and Collagen Hydrolysates--ingredients that have been shown to decrease the risk of stretch marks by 39 percent. And with calming lavender and sweet almond, Belli Oil is sure to sooth tired moms-to-be.



The last thing any expectant mother wants to worry about is her skin. As a mom-to-be, pregnancy should be a time for excitement, not a time for agonizing about the challenges of a changing body. Luckily, Belli has taken the worry out of pregnancy skincare by creating a complete line of products that are specially formulated to address your needs as an expectant mom, especially the need to know that you are making the healthiest choices for your baby.

Proven Protection Against Stretch marks

During the second and third trimesters of your pregnancy, your uterus will grow rapidly, stretching the skin over your abdomen. This rapid growth may tear your skin's inner connective tissues, resulting in stretch marks on your belly. Normal pregnancy growth may also increase fat deposits in your breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks, and may result in scarring of those areas.

Affecting 90 percent of all women, stretch marks may seem like an unavoidable part of motherhood, but luckily there are things you can you can do to minimize your risk. Published research on stretch mark prevention shows that a combination of Gotu Kola extract, Vitamin E, and Collagen Hydrolysates decreases the risk of acquiring stretch marks by about 39 percent and decreases the severity of any stretch marks that do form. All of these ingredients can be found in Belli Pregnancy's Elasticity Belly Oil, along with the relaxing aromas of lavender and almond oil.

Pampering for Mom, Protection for Baby

While many topical ingredients are thought to be safe during pregnancy, a large number are linked to harmful effects that occur after repeated or high exposures. Some examples include Vitamin A, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, certain sunscreens, and even aloe vera. While your skin blocks many skin care ingredients from entering your body, small amounts of some ingredients are still absorbed into your bloodstream. Once there, they can cross the placenta and reach your growing baby.

This is why Belli screens each ingredient to exclude chemicals that have been linked to birth defects and pregnancy-related problems. As the only line in the world to do so, Belli also allergy tests all of its products and ensures they are free of synthetic dyes, phthalates, and paraben preservatives.

What's in the Box: One four-ounce bottle of Belli Elasticity Belly Oil



Belli supports expectant and new mothers by providing soothing, balanced skin products that pamper and protect. Three skincare collections--Belli Pregnancy, Belli Motherhood, and Belli Baby--address the specific needs of each stage while giving thoughtful attention to the safest formulations. Belli's goal is to support and encourage new mothers, inspiring self-confidence and greater safety in both pregnancy and parenting.

2612,"Lip Venom was the very first lip plumper on the market, creating the lip plumping category for the beauty industry. The tingly gloss uses essential oils to enhance lips' natural color and shape by increasing circulation. The result: fuller bee stung lips. To really plump up your pout, use a toothbrush to gently scrub your lips before applying Lip Venom. The secret behind Lip Venom is a blend of essential oils, which include cinnamon, wintergreen, and ginger, that cause the blood to rush to the surface of the lips, flushing and swelling them slightly. The gloss also includes jojoba and avocado oil that moisturize and give the lips intense shine. You end up with a shiny, naturally rosy pout that cannot be achieved by wearing ordinary lip gloss. DuWop Lip Venom contains no sulfates, no petrochemicals, no fragrances, no dyes, no phthalates, no GMO's, no PPG's, no MEA's, no DEA's, no TEA's, no formaldehyde and no triclosan. DuWop does not test on animals.

This flat iron has a removable water reservoir for added styling options. It also includes: Retractable combs, 30 second instant heat up, easy-to-read temperature display, professional line cord, and a heat resistant pouch and mat.

Introducing the Infiniti Nano Silver Steam Straightener by Conair. Like electronics manufacturers who use state-of-the-art laboratories to develop new technologies, Conair® develops products for salon professionals before offering them to the public. A long tradition of innovation and technology testifies to our expertise. Case in point: the state-of-the-art ionic steam straightener. This outstanding straightener features unparalleled heat steam technology. This unique technology uses steam and ions to straighten the hair while eliminating frizz and flyaways. The result is sleek, shiny, and beautiful hair. Ultimate efficiency  even on resistant or fragile hair. Micro-particles of nano silver coat the straighteners surface. The fusion of ceramic and tourmaline gives the plates optimal resistance to highest temperatures and guarantees the integrity of the surface. Your hair glides through the plates effortlessly, without friction. The integrity of your hair is preserved.









2-Stage styling and advanced technology
Youll love what our new high-tech 2-stage styling system can do for your hair. As nano silver makes plates glide smoothly through hair, Tourmaline Ceramic™ smoothes hairs cuticle layer to protect it from heat damage. The 2-step styling system first infuses hair with conditioning steam, and then locks in all that healthy moisture with heated plates. The results are sensational: silky, shinier, pin-straight styles that last! The advanced Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic™ technology and our 2-stage styling system lets you achieve longer lasting salon-straight looks, every time you style!

Retractable Detangling Combs
The retractable detangling combs separate tangles and tame even the most unruly frizz! The detangling comb spread the hair strands evenly between the plates to detangle while straightening, providing uniform results from roots to ends. Three different comb heights, high, low and off, make this the perfect straightener for any hair type, even thick and coarse textures. Three settings let you choose from low to maximum tension control. Set the comb height that is best for your hair type. Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic™ coating on the combs provides smooth glide and shiny, healthy looking results.

Steam Benefits
Automatic multi-level steam function steams hair straight while smoothing the cuticle layer and helping to lock in style. Conditioning steam helps add moisture and shine to hair, so you get salon results at home. Simply fill the removable water reservoir and pop into place for up to 20 minutes of hair-conditioning steam. The steam feature may be turned on or off, and you can choose high or low steam settings depending on your hair type for perfectly smooth and straight results. For coarse hair, select the high steam setting.

Ionic Benefits
Ionic properties neutralize positive charges in the air, reducing the static electricity that dulls hair and causes flyaways and frizzes. Hair instantly becomes more manageable and shiny. The ionic steam straightener is equipped with a true ion generator that releases 2 million ions / cm3. Steam and ions create increased softness and brilliant shine for flawless results.

Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic™ Coated Plates
Micro-particles of nano silver coat the straighteners surface. The fusion of ceramic and tourmaline gives the plates optimal resistance to the highest temperatures and guarantees the integrity of the surface. Your hair glides through the plates effortlessly, without friction. The integrity of your hair is preserved. Keeping your straighteners easy glide plates clean is effortless, because of its nonstick surface. Simply wipe plates with a damp cloth after each use to remove any product buildup.

Electronic Temperature Control
The new ionic steam straightener with electronic temperature control generates ultra-high heat that is capable of straightening hair in only one stroke, without damaging it. Four ceramic heaters ensure fast heat-up to 202°C/395°F and keep the temperature constant and uniform while straightening the hair. Five temperature settings allow you to choose from low, for fine or processed hair, to high, for coarse, thick hair.

Professional Pouch
The ionic steam straightener comes with a high-quality, multi-layered, heat resistant professional mat and pouch. The 2-in-1 storage pouch and counter mat folds and snaps closed to store your hot styling iron safely. When straightening, rest your steam straightener on the open mat to protect your countertops from heat.

Professional 9 Swivel Cord
The ionic steam straightener is equipped with a professional 9-foot swivel cord that rotates 360° to prevent tangling and to make straightening your hair easy from any angle.
