In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers’ union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer’s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as “inoxydable"" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland. Care Tips for Swiss Army KnivesThe various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.SharpeningTo re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15°– 20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.CleaningAfter you’ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.

About Gerber: A History of Innovation
Savvy. Moxie. Craftsmanship. Attention to detail. These are just a few of the company traits that have contributed to Gerber's emergence as a world leader in outdoor gear. Joseph Gerber started Portland, Oregon's Gerber Advertising back in 1910, and one Christmas, he hired a local knife-maker to craft 25 sets of kitchen cutlery as client gifts. The knives were so popular Mr. Gerber ultimately left his agency to launch Gerber Legendary Blades in 1939.

It makes sense, really. An idea man gets the idea of a lifetime and turns it into a major outdoor brand--one that commands respect among knife lovers and knife makers alike. And now that same high regard is spreading in new directions, in the form of many outstanding products such as tools, personal L.E.D. lighting, and more.

The lock-back clip point blade has a serrated edge and is forged from 420HC stainless steel. Sheathed in a heavy-duty nylon case, the Gator is still one of Gerber’s most popular folders.

Renowned as a master of knives and tools, Gerber’s problem-solving, life-saving products are designed with the unique needs of specific activities in mind.

Founded in 1939 and based in Portland, Oregon, USA, Gerber is an American brand whose products have global reach and relevance. Carried extensively by hunters, soldiers and tradesmen, Gerber’s heritage runs deep. And we are now looking toward the future, where tomorrow’s problems will be solved by the next generation of innovations.

When Joseph R. Gerber described his young knife company, Gerber Legendary Blades, as the, “birth of an enterprise that grew into big business,” it was true, but it was an understatement for sure. What had started out in 1939 as a small batch of handmade cutlery sets given as holiday gifts had turned into thousands of retail accounts around the country. By 1960, Gerber had quickly become one of the most trusted, appreciated and collected names in knives.

Over 70 years since its founding and Gerber continues to grow. Still grounded in the same principles that first guided Joseph R. Gerber’s “enterprise,” Gerber is a company dedicated to making knives and tools that combine high quality materials and innovative designs that will stand up to a lifetime of use. The sleek, stainless steel sheath knives of the ’50s and ’60s (the Magnum Hunter) have given birth to today’s lightweight, open-frame clip folders (the Remix). Gerber is, however, no longer just a knife company. Multi-tools, axes, handsaws, machetes, headlamps, flashlights, survival kits, digging implements - these are the newest directions that Gerber explores with the same standards of quality and design that inform their revered knife making.

In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier's Knife and in 1897 with the Officer's Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as ""inoxydable"" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born. Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.

Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives
The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.

Sharpening
To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15°– 20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.

Cleaning
After you’ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again.

About Allen Bike Racks
In 1967, after a few years of working on the aerospace technology for the Apollo missions, Dick Allen was out of a job. Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his familys bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities.

Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dicks son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.

54,"The Coleman Queen-Sized Quickbed is a great choice for camping, overnight guests, or anywhere you need an extra bed. Measuring 78"" long by 60"" wide when inflated (fitting standard queen-sized sheets), the Quickbed is made of heavy-duty, puncture-resistant PVC, with 48 coils inside and a soft suede top for extra comfort. The Quickbed is easy to inflate and deflate, thanks to Coleman's extra-wide Advanced Double Lock Valve. Like all Coleman inflatable products, this Quickbed features Coleman's Airtight System, guaranteed not to leak. And the built-in Wrap 'N' Roll storage system makes packing and storing quick and easy.

Large enough to easily accommodate two adults (or four small children), this queen-size Quickbed gets its name from Double-Lock valves that allow it to inflate 10 times quicker than air beds with pinch valves. And if you think inflating time is quick, when morning rolls around you'll find that, thanks to the Double-Lock valves, the air beds deflate 20 times faster as well. Keep one of these queen-size flocked air beds around for camping trips, unexpected guests, or kids' slumber parties (the mattress will accommodate fitted or flat queen-size sheets). The heavy-duty PVC construction is designed to endure all sorts of abuse, but if anything should happen, a repair kit is included. The green-flocked rayon top can be a little prone to dust, but it does add warmth and softness for colder nights. The air bed can hold up to 600 pounds. Its 56 coils and 6-inch side gussets provide support and, unless you sit down from a height, keep you from bumping the ground. Pump sold separately.

57,"This professional electric 2-Stage knife sharpener sharpens both straight edge and serrated knives to better than factory edges, in just minutes.

When your favorite knives start squishing ripe tomatoes instead of slicing them, it's time to sharpen your blades. This knife sharpener is remarkably easy to use on both straight-edge and serrated knives. Simply plug it in, turn it on, and feed knife blades through the stages. The first sharpening stage uses 100 percent diamond abrasive disks to hone the knife's edge while the second stage incorporates polymer disks to polish and strop the edge to hairsplitting sharpness. Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be used in the polishing stage.

The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces. Guaranteed not to detemper, the sharpener has a two-year warranty for home use. --Ariel Meadow Stallings

About Coleman More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

About Everlast:
The name Everlast is synonymous with boxing. Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910. Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name, Everlast. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.

Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the world's heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50 percent of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family's remaining 50 percent interest. Nadorf remained the president and principle share holder of Everlast until Oct. 24, 2000.

Everlast men's and women's apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states. Everlast has a traditional past and a knockout future.

Designed to light easily with matches, the Powerhouse lantern comes with a filter funnel.

About Coleman
More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.

In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.

SHARPENING
To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15°– 20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.

CLEANING
If the blades of knife begin to stick together, open and close the blades in warm water several times - this will allow the tools to move easily again. Once dry, apply a drop of Swiss Army Knife Oil between each tool and its spring. Do not put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.

HISTORY & HERITAGE
In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland.

About Victorinox
In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

SOG products have also won favor among law enforcement, military and industrial customers that rely on their tools to perform flawlessly in the toughest, most adverse conditions.



After surviving one of the most extensive test and evaluation programs ever undertaken by the U.S. Government, including knives from most U.S. cutlery manufacturers, the SOG SEAL Knife triumphed. The SEALs are one of the most specialized elite military groups in the world today. SEALs must undergo one of the most rigorous training programs devised to produce the consummate warrior.

 

Only a select few endure and earn the right to wear the SEAL Trident on their uniform. The SEAL knife evaluation program included: tip breaking stress, blade breaking limit, sharpness, edge retention, handle twist off force, two week salt water immersion tests, gasoline and acetylene torch resistance, chopping, hammering, prying, penetration tests, cutting six different types of rope and line, plus an intense hands-on competition in the field.

The SEAL Team fixed blade knife from SOG Specialty Knives & Tools (model S37-N) is complemented by a black tactical nylon sheath. All SOG products are guaranteed against defects in workmanship and materials for the life of the original purchaser.

SOG's unique cryogenic heat treatment process increases the toughness and wear resistance of our blades. Taking the knife slowly down in temperature to less than -300 degrees F and then back to room temperature. This stress relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength as well as edge retention. Knife edges stay sharp longer with significantly less micro-fracturing and edge-chipping.

Keeping your knife clean, dry, oiled and sharp are the primary defenses against corrosion, wear, and potential injury. Be sure to clean the blade and handle after each use--however, do not soak your knife in water. A mild solution of soap and water should remove any dirt and debris that may have accumulated during use (avoid harsh detergents such as laundry or dish soap, and chlorine products).

After cleaning or after exposure to moisture be sure to completely dry your knife blade and handle, taking special care with any sensitive handle materials. Use a soft cotton cloth or chamois and a small amount of moisture-displacing oil (such as WD-40 or 3-in-1), on the blade only, to prevent water spots and oxidation from forming. Fingerprints and weather are the primary causes of rusting or corrosion on a knife blade. To keep your knife looking its best, SOG recommends that you give your blade a light coat of oil after each cleaning, and prior to long term storage.

101,"Sports hearing protectors suppress gun fire and other impulse noises. Hunting gear features stereo microphones for enhanced sound detection to amplify low level sounds. Low profile ear cups make it the choice of long gun shooters everywhere.



A good hearing protector should remove harmful noise, be comfortable to wear, and be able to be used for all types of shooting activities, construction work, and DIY projects. The new Peltor Tac 6 truly lives up to all these criteria. The protector is supplied with different colored, easy-to-change, headset cups that fill a practical function when hunting in teams. The color differentiation improves safety and makes the wearer easily visible to other hunters. In addition to being lightweight, the Tactical 6S is foldable that takes up less space in your backpack or jacket pocket. The headband conveniently adjusts for maximum comfort. Volume control is easily adjustable and it’s equipped with an automatic shut-off function. Both a radio and dog tracker can be connected directly to the hearing protector.



The 3M Peltor Tactical 6S serves many purposes for individuals who are around high-decibel sounds for a prolonged period of time. With active volume hearing technology, the Tactical 6S allows wearers to be adaptive to the environment and alert to low-decibel noises such as others voices. Whether on the range, hunting in the woods, or working in the garage, your hearing protection should instill you with confidence that safety is accounted for.

Test out any 3M Peltor hearing protection with active volume technology to demonstrate the difference. Simply put on your 3M Peltor Tactical 6S ear protection and begin a conversation with one of your hunting buddies to see how low decibel-emitting sounds are amplified. You will be able to carry on your conversation in an environment where other loud noises are going on around you. High decibel noises such as cheering at a football game, shooting at the firing range, and the roaring of engines at the track will all be minimized so that you can communicate with your friends and family and still be able to focus on working or enjoying your sporting event.

Magnification (Power): Riflescopes are often referred to by two numbers separated by an ""x"". For example: 4x40. The first number is the power or magnification of the scope. With a ""4x"", the object being viewed appears to be four times closer than when seen with the unaided eye.

Objective Lens Size: The second number in the formula (4x40) is the diameter of the objective or front lens. The larger the objective lens, the more light that enters the scope, and the brighter the image.

Field of View (F.O.V.): The side-to-side measurement of the circular viewing field or subject area. It is defined by the width in feet or meters of the area visible at 1000 yards or meters. A wide angle binocular features a wide field of view and is better for following action. Generally, the higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view.

Reticle: A reticle is the crosshair or pattern placed in the eyepiece of the scope which establishes the gun's position on the target.

The high volume whisper quiet rotary blower provides a blast of heated or unheated air for super fast drying. Weighing in at 2-1/2 pounds, the DryGuy will take up very little space on your next outdoor trip or as a permanent fixture at your vacation home.

There's nothing better than a nice warm pair of boots or gloves when heading outside for a day on the slopes. Conversely, there's nothing worse than starting your day off with a soaking wet boot liner or jacket. Well now you can have the best of both worlds with the DryGuy boot and glove dryer. Boasting four extra-tall air chambers and a whisper-quiet rotary blower, the DryGuy blasts heated or unheated air on up to four garments at once.

The DryGuy employs gently warmed Forced Air technology, which is guaranteed to protect your boot liners and eliminate unpleasant odor. The approximate temperature of the air coming out of the nozzle is 99 degrees F, warm enough to dry garments without causing damage. Plus, by eliminating moisture, the DryGuy prevents the growth of bacteria and mold. The DryGuy also offers a three-hour timer for particularly wet garments and a 6-foot cord that should reach most outlets. The DryGuy carries a one-year warranty.

About Shakespeare Fishing Tackle
Founded in 1897 by William Shakespeare, Jr., an avid fisherman of 27 years, Shakespeare Fishing Tackle has been a revered name within the fishing business for more than a century. Among William's first inventions was the level-wind reel, which was designed to wind fishing line evenly back on the spool. Now common on most fishing reels, the level-wind reel was a revelation at the time, and helped propel Shakespeare into prominence in the early part of the 20th century. In the ensuing years, Shakespeare introduced such innovations as the Backlash brake, which prevented spools from backlashing; the glass fiber Wonderod; the pushbutton Wondercast spinning reel; the Ugly Stik tubular fishing rod; and the Synergy spincast reels. Shakespeare Fishing Tackle is headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina.

381,"The Coleman Taos Extreme-Weather Mummy Bag is a great choice for cold-weather sleeping. Featuring 38 ounces of Coletherm insulation, the Taos keeps you comfortable down to 25°F. The double-batt, offset quilt construction eliminates potential cold spots, while the bag's semi-sculpted hood surrounds your head with warmth. The full-length draft tube locks out chilly drafts, while a 2-way zipper provides maximum ventilation when you want it. The Taos bag is designed with a box-foot silhouette to give your feet extra wiggle room. Stuff sack included. Commercial machine washable. 5-year limited warranty.

Stay warm and comfortable on a chilly fall evening with the Coleman Taos mummy sleeping bag. The Taos, which offers a temperature rating down to 25 degrees F, is filled with 38 ounces of Coletherm insulation. This allows for a greater loft--a measure of the amount of space the insulation occupies and the amount of air the insulation can trap. The bag also offers several other features to fight the chill, including a double-batt, offset quilt construction that eliminates potential cold spots, a semi-sculpted hood that surrounds the head with warmth, and a full-length, insulated draft tube that locks out drafts. And to help the bag last through the years, Coleman added a durable polyester and diamond ripstop cover that resists tears.



Coleman developed a number of warmth-enhancing features for its ComfortSmart system. The FiberLock insulation tailoring, for example, is designed to prevent insulation from shifting in the bag and developing thin or cold spots. By keeping the insulation in place, Coleman also lengthens the life of the bag. The ThermoLock feature contributes by reducing heat loss (and cold seepage) through zipper coils. This sets up an additional insulating barrier to stand guard along the length of the zipper, ensuring that the snug feeling campers get when zipping up the bag stays with them through the night. Coleman also added such features as a ZipPlow zipper tool, which prevents zipper snags by channeling fabric away from the zipper coils, and Zipper Glide tailoring, which makes it silky smooth to zip the bag at the corners.

Sizing
The Taos is a tall sleeping bag, with dimensions of 82 by 32 inches. As a result, the bag fits most people up to 6 feet 2 inches tall. And despite the mummy bag construction, Coleman added a box-foot silhouette to give your feet extra wiggle room.

Also equipped with a two-way zipper for maximum ventilation, the Taos comes with a stuff sack and carries a five-year warranty.

About Coleman
More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.

In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

Sleep Well: Finding the Right Sleeping Bag
Sleeping bag technology has come a long way from the days of cowboy bedrolls. These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag:

Buy for Cold
It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees F or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35 degrees F. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 degrees F range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10 degrees F.

Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated 10 degrees colder. The opposite is true for ""warm"" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night.

Goose or No Goose?
The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly and stay warm through the winter. Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use.

All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market, and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down, while synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget.

Bags for All Shapes
Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips.

Pad Yourself
No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

Always remove cookware from the stovetop after cooking.

Seasoned for a natural, easy-release finish that improves with use.

Seasoning is a necessary step in using cast iron cookware. Oil is baked into the pores of the iron at the foundry to prevent rusting and to eventually provide a natural, non-stick cooking surface. Unlike synthetically coated cookware, it is possible to restore the cooking surface of cast iron.

Lodge uses a proprietary soy-based vegetable oil to season our cookware. The oil contains no animal fat or peanut oil. The seasoning is functional application and slight inconsistencies may appear in the seasoning finish. The inconsistencies will not affect cooking performance.

Hand wash, dry, rub with cooking oil. It is very important to replenish the seasoning of your cast iron cookware by applying a thin layer of oil after each cleaning. Seasoning is an on-going process. The more you use cast iron, the seasoning is improved.

Rinse with hot water (do not use soap), and dry thoroughly.

Before cooking, apply vegetable oil to the cooking surface of your pan and pre-heat the pan slowly (always start on low heat, increasing the temperature slowly).

Once the utensil is properly pre-heated, you are ready to cook.

TIP: Avoid cooking very cold food in the pan, as this can promote sticking.

PLEASE REMEMBER: Handles will become very hot in the oven, and on the stovetop. Always use an oven mitt to prevent burns when removing pans from oven or stovetop.

After cooking, clean utensil with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. (Avoid putting a hot utensil into cold water. Thermal shock can occur causing the metal to warp or crack).

If you are having trouble removing stuck-on food, boil some water in your pan for a few minutes to loosen residue, making it easier to remove.

Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to the utensil while it is still warm.

TIP: Do not let your cast iron air dry, as this can promote rust.

Store in a cool, dry place. If you have a cover, or lid, for your utensil, place a folded paper towel in between lid and utensil allowing air to circulate. This prevents moisture from collecting inside the utensil, which can cause rust.

TIP: The oven is a great place to store your cast iron; just remember to remove it before turning on the oven.

NEVER wash in dishwasher.

If for some reason your utensil develops a metallic smell or taste, or perhaps rust spots (maybe a well-meaning relative washed your utensil in the dishwasher or with soap thinking they were being helpful), never fear. Simply scour off the rust using a very fine grade of sandpaper or steel wool and refer to our section on re-seasoning.

While maintaining the seasoning should keep your Cast Iron in good condition, at some point you may need to repeat the seasoning process. If food sticks to the surface, or you notice a dull, gray color, repeat the seasoning process:

Wash the cookware with hot, soapy water and a stiff brush. (It is okay to use soap this time because you are preparing to re-season the cookware).

Rinse and dry completely. Apply a thin, even coating of MELTED solid vegetable shortening (or cooking oil of your choice) to the cookware (inside and out).

Place aluminum foil on the bottom rack of the oven to catch any dripping.

Set oven temperature to 350 - 400 degrees F.

Place cookware upside down on the top rack of the oven.

Bake the cookware for at least one hour. After the hour, turn the oven off and let the cookware cool in the oven.

Store the cookware uncovered, in a dry place when cooled.

For over 112 years, Lodge has provided quality cast iron cookware and accessories, with a broad and innovative assortment. Our continued commitment to quality enables Lodge to offer a superior product line.

We measure from outside rim to outside rim across the top of the cookware, not the bottom.

We recommend using wood or silicone utensils to avoid scratching.

Soap and detergent are used to break down and remove oils. Since the seasoning of your cast iron consists of oil, cleaning with soap will strip or remove the seasoning from cookware.

Foods which are very acidic (i.e. beans, tomatoes, citrus juices, etc.) should not be cooked in a cast iron utensil until the cookware is highly seasoned. The high acidity of these foods will strip the seasoning and result in discoloration and metallic tasting food. Wait until cast iron is better seasoned to cook these types of foods.

Lodge is a zero hazardous waste stream foundry. Lodge designed a vegetable oil recycler for the seasoning process to reduce waste and unusable oil is recycled and used as biodiesel generator. Lodge uses recycled and biodegradable packing materials. Reuse of foundry sand used in the casting process is recycled and unusable sand, working to purify the water of the local streams and planting trees to improve air quality and beautification.

Lodge is the oldest family-owned cookware foundry in America. Since 1896, the Lodge family has been casting premium iron cookware at their Tennessee foundry. Starting with raw materials and finishing with their seasoning process, they continue to improve on the highest quality standards that go into every piece we make. As the sole American manufacturer of cast iron cookware, they are proud to carry on the legacy started by founder Joseph Lodge. Lodge doesn't just make cast iron; they make heirlooms that bring people together for generations.

History and Heritage
In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers’ union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer’s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as “inoxydable"" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.

Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.

Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives
The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.

Sharpening
To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15°– 20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.

Cleaning
After you’ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.

418,"Flick the “kick” on the back of the Twitch II and the knife’s 2.65” AUS-8 stainless steel blade jumps from the rosewood handle in the blink of an eye. That’s thanks to SOG Assisted Technology (S.A.T.), a system of opposing high-tension coils that propels the blade open instantly once you give it a flick



Looking at the intricate construction of the Twitches reminds us of the workings in a fine chronograph watch; everything right and precisely in its place. These techno wizards feature a pass-through lockbar (patent pending) from which the 'kick' of the blade sticks through. By pressing on the 'kick', one is able to initiate the opening of the blade. S.A.T. (SOG Assisted Technology) then takes over to finish opening and to securely lock the blade open. What makes these space-age little gems even more beautiful is that they are also affordable, and it's now available with a rosewood handle for that classic outdoorsman look.

Start to open the blade, and let SOG Assisted Technology (S.A.T.) finish the action with a bang, using one of the surest assisted technologies out there. Tactile bumps and cutouts aid in control while all features are purposeful and functional. The patent-pending safety is used to insure the retention of the blade in the handle as well as acts as a double lock in the open position.

Thumb grooves on the stainless steel handle provide a comfortable and controlled grip. It also includes a reversible bayonet pocket clip for a close carry and quick access. All SOG products are guaranteed against defects in workmanship and materials for the life of the original purchaser.

Keeping your knife clean, dry, oiled and sharp are the primary defenses against corrosion, wear, and potential injury. Be sure to clean the blade and handle after each use--however, do not soak your knife in water. A mild solution of soap and water should remove any dirt and debris that may have accumulated during use (avoid harsh detergents such as laundry or dish soap, and chlorine products). To remove any debris from inside the handle you can use a toothpick for any visible lint or dirt, or a Q-Tip for smaller amounts of dirt and debris.

After cleaning or after exposure to moisture be sure to completely dry your knife blade and handle, taking special care with any sensitive handle materials. Use a soft cotton cloth or chamois and a small amount of moisture-displacing oil (such as WD-40 or 3-in-1), on the blade only, to prevent water spots and oxidation from forming.

Fingerprints and weather are the primary causes of rusting or corrosion on a knife blade. To keep your knife looking its best, SOG recommends that you give your blade a light coat of oil after each cleaning, and prior to long-term storage. Be sure to also apply a Paraffin-based oil to the pivot point, which will not only keep the action of your blade smooth but will repel dirt and debris which could impede the blade's action.

The Tool Logic Credit Card Companion (model CC1SB) is so light and slim that you'll barely know you have it, yet when needed you'll find it's amazingly useful. The 2-inch stainless blade is razor sharp and serrated to cut through even the toughest materials with ease. It also features a combination can/bottle opener, awl, 8x power lens and compass, tweezers and toothpick, plus inch and centimeter rulers on the back. At just 1.3 ounces, it packs effortlessly for travel both on and off-road.

Keeping your knife clean, dry, oiled and sharp are the primary defenses against corrosion, wear, and potential injury. Be sure to clean the blade and handle after each use--however, do not soak your knife in water. A mild solution of soap and water should remove any dirt and debris that may have accumulated during use (avoid harsh detergents such as laundry or dish soap, and chlorine products). To remove any debris from inside the handle you can use a toothpick for any visible lint or dirt, or a Q-Tip for smaller amounts of dirt and debris.

After cleaning or after exposure to moisture be sure to completely dry your knife blade and handle, taking special care with any sensitive handle materials. Use a soft cotton cloth or chamois and a small amount of moisture-displacing oil (such as WD-40 or 3-in-1), on the blade only, to prevent water spots and oxidation from forming.

Fingerprints and weather are the primary causes of rusting or corrosion on a knife blade. To keep your knife looking its best, Tool Logic recommends that you give your blade a light coat of oil after each cleaning, and prior to long-term storage. Be sure to also apply a Paraffin-based oil to the pivot point, which will not only keep the action of your blade smooth but will repel dirt and debris which could impede the blade's action.

Just crank the handle and watch your glowing embers blaze! The unit will not produce greater 'air volume' no matter how fast or hard you crank the handle. By steadily cranking the handle, you will get the maximum amount of 'air volume' which the product produces. Over cranking the unit or stopping the unit handle from free spinning when in use, will cause damage and in some cases, breakage, to the unit’s internal gears.

Amazon.com Product Description Canon's 12x36 Image Stabilization II binoculars incorporate an optical image stabilizer for shake-free viewing with minimal eye fatigue. This technology was first developed for Canon video camcorders and is now available in many of Canon's binoculars. The system employs a Vari-Angle Prism, dual transparent plates, independent vertical and horizontal sensors, and a dedicated microprocessor to continuously adjust the prism to maintain a steady image.

These 12x36 Image Stabilization II binoculars feature a water-resistant rubber coating for nonslip holding. If you get caught in light rain, you don't have to worry about the optics fogging up or getting ruined. These binoculars deliver high magnification, long eye relief, and wide-field viewing. Controls for focusing and image stabilization are centrally located and are accessible by both hands.

Improvements to the objective lens assembly have resulted in the binoculars being approximately 26% lighter and 10% smaller than the previous 12x36 IS model they replace. And reductions in power consumption mean a massive 270% increase in battery life of up to four hours using two AA-size alkaline batteries.

Image Stabilization and More
With any high magnification binoculars, most users will experience frustrating image shake. Unless fixed to a tripod, image shake can render high magnification binoculars useless. Canon's IS technology is remarkably effective at eliminating this problem and is widely used by the television industry with Canon's professional broadcast quality video recording equipment. A special VAP (Vari-Angle Prism) corrective IS system sits between the objective lens group and the porro prism on each side of the binoculars. Within thousandths of a second of the binoculars being moved from their optical axis by vibrations, a detection system activates the IS mechanism. The VAP shape alters to refract or 'bend' the light path by precisely the right amount, thus fully compensating for the vibration. It is this essentially immediate response that effectively suppresses image shake. The binoculars' compact design is based on Canon's popular 10x30 IS model. Curved surfaces mean easy handling, while nature lovers will appreciate the low-reflectance exterior and low gloss front covers, which help to avoid disturbing birds and other

What do the numbers mean?
15x50? 8x25? The two numbers used to describe any pair of binoculars are their magnification — 8x, 12x, 15x and so on — and the diameter of their objective lenses — 25mm, 36mm, 50mm, and so on. The larger the first number is, the larger the object will appear to be in the objective lens. For instance, if you use a 10x lens and look at an object that is 100 yards away, it appears to be the same size as an object located just 10 yards away. The second number, the size of the objective lens, is important because the larger the objective lens, the more light it can admit for brighter, more detailed images, and the better suited they will be for lowlight situations.

Give it a push on either Thumbstud and the 3.75” blade jumps from the handle as if coiled and ready to strike. That’s thanks to SOG Assisted Technology (S.A.T.), a system of opposing high-tension coils that propels the blade open instantly once you give it a flick.

The SOG Trident uses our well-proven means of delivering a knife blade to the open position with the new SOG Assisted Technology. Now using our patent pending Arc-Actuator, the Trident locks stronger and releases easier. There is also a built-in safety to lock the blade closed. What also makes the Trident so unique is the patent pending Groove in the handle to cut paracord, fishing line, etc. without having to open the blade. The handle also includes a Digi-Grip variable pattern for coarser grip in areas that require it. Our bayonet style clip is easily switched for right and left hand carry or removed for pouch storage.

Made of AUS-8 steel with an attractive tigerstripe finish, the 3.5-inch partially serrated, folding blade has a drop point shape that makes quick work of any task. When you start to open the blade, SOG’s patented S.A.T. (SOG Assisted Technology) takes over and high-tension coil springs propel the blade the rest of the way open for fast, easy, one-handed access. A Piston lock utilizes a movable bar wedged between the blade tang and knife handle to securely lock the blade in place when in the open position. The ergonomically contoured and well balanced handle has a black finish and is made of a high strength, abrasion and impact resistant glass-reinforced nylon that will fit comfortably in your hand. A reversible pocket clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the Flash to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible. This feature can also be used as a money clip. The FSA5-CP has a closed length of 4.5-inches, overall length of 8-inches, blade thickness of 0.13-inches and weighs 3.1-ounces. The SOG Specialty Knives & Tools FSA5-CP Flash II Knife with Partially Serrated Folding 3.5-Inch Steel Blade comes with a limited lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials. Each SOG product is created with the help of company founder and chief engineer, Spencer Frazer. Known for their uncompromising style and performance, these knives and tools showcase innovation, dependability and a unique, futuristic style that has garnered awards and recognition worldwide.

Sleek, elegant, and easy to operate, the FSA-5 Half-Serrated Tiger Stripe Knife from the Flash II Series showcases SOG Specialty Knives' commitment to creating style through craftsmanship. Featuring advanced opening and locking technology combined with a well-balanced body and a strong, dependable blade, this versatile folding knife makes quick work of whatever task is at hand.



For security and peace of mind, S.A.T. was developed in conjunction with a superior locking system. The unique design of S.A.T. knives allows them to use locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access ambidextrously than conventional liner locks.

For Flash Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be released quickly with a sliding button. An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed. For easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to open.

Cryogenic Heat Treatment for Sharp, Dependable Blades
Of course the workhorse of any knife is the cutting surface, and the FSA-5 offers a full, 3.5-inch, half-serrated blade finished with an elegant tiger stripe TiNi, which is a durable titanium and nickel compound.

SOG's proprietary Cryogenic Heat Treatment process ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly bringing the blade's temperature down to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then bringing it slowly back to room temperature. The stress created through this process relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength and edge retention.

Elegant, Ergonomic Design for Ease of Use
Even if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make the cuts you want if a knife doesn't sit comfortably in your hand. That's why the handle on this knife features a unique, ergonomic contour. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle helps ensure that your knife is both durable and well-balanced. And it is lightly textured to prevent slippage.

At just 3.1 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.

This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in workmanship and materials.

Outdoor enthusiasts and adventurers will love it for observing nature and sharp long-distance spotting.

The Ultima spotting scope is completely waterproof and fogproof. It’s been filled with dry nitrogen gas and sealed to prevent internal fogging of the lenses. You’ll be able to enjoy your viewing activities to the fullest even during extreme weather conditions! The Ultima 80 angled spotting scope also includes a T-mount adapter for digiscoping; this allows you to capture bright, sharp images through your spotting scope.

You’ll also receive a Limited Lifetime warranty and unlimited access to technical support from our team of US-based experts.



The Ultima 80 features a sleek, waterproof design and includes a padded soft case with zippers on both ends so the scope can be protected even while mounted on a tripod. Including the eyepiece the Ultima 80 measures just over 18 inches long and weighs about 3.6 pounds. The rubber eyecup can be removed to expose a standard “T-thread” for attaching a camera. I like the 45* angled eyepiece because I can use a shorter tripod to support the spotting scope while viewing or while taking pictures with a small camera attached to the eyepiece.

The focus ranges from 27 feet to the horizon with just a few turns of the focus knob. When I fold down the rubber eye cup I can keep my glasses on and see the whole 2 degree field of view at 20X magnification. With my glasses on I need very little focus adjustment while I crank the zoom eyepiece from 20X up to 60X. Sometimes though I like to take my glasses off while observing because the view seems to have just a little more contrast and sharpness. I like the fact that the Ultima 80 gives me a sharp image either way.

The drawback of the tradition crown and flint achromatic lens used in the Ultima 80 Zoom Spotting Scope is a bit of false color, also known as blue fringing or chromatic aberration. Blue fringing seems well controlled at 20X magnification, but it becomes increasingly noticeable as I zoom up to 60X. Celestron also offers the Ultima 80ED and the Regal 80 F-ED spotting scopes which use exotic ED glass lenses to virtually eliminate blue fringing and produce the sharpest possible high power views.

About Daisy
More Americans have taken their first shot with a Daisy BB gun than any other brand. The company's roots trace back to the late 1870s in Plymouth, Michigan, the result of a collaboration between the Plymouth Iron Windmill Company and Plymouth Air Rifle Company. Company founder, watchmaker, and inventor Clarence Hamilton developed an all-metal air gun of his own design, which was originally a bonus item sold to every farmer who purchased a windmill. When Hamilton presented his prototype to the company's board of directors for examination, General Manager L.C. Hough test fired the weapon and exclaimed, in a popular colloquialism of the time, ""Boy! That's a daisy!"" So that's what they named the gun.

By 1895, sales and popularity of the Daisy had grown so rapidly, the company ceased manufacturing windmills, focused exclusively on producing air guns, and changed its name to Daisy Manufacturing Company. The company has continued to grow over time -- adding models like the renowned Red Ryder, innovative new PowerLine products for advanced shooters, Avanti guns for match competition, and a Winchester-branded line -- and is now based in Rogers, Arkansas.

Already famous for high quality and innovative designs, Galco gained worldwide notoriety when the Jackass shoulder system became a ""recurring character"" on the popular 1980's TV series Miami Vice. In the new century, Galco continues to be a favorite choice of Hollywood, appearing in more films and TV shows than any other holster maker. Perhaps more importantly, Galco remains a major force in real-world firearms usage.

For professionals and home cooks who are confident in their technique, this sharpening rod is a quick and effective way to hone and gently realign the folded-over edge of a knife blade. The rod's surface is coated with diamond dust, the hardest and most abrasive material for honing knives, requiring only a few strokes with light pressure while holding the blade at a 20-degree angle. The extra-fine grit on this rod is appropriate for frequent touch-ups or as a final honing step to polish an edge that has already been sharpened on a coarser grit. A steel should always be longer than the blade it is honing and, at 12 inches long, this diamond sharpening rod can be used to maintain all kitchen knives. The steel has a sanitary black plastic handle with a guard to protect hands. Its pointed end affixes into a cutting board to hold the rod still for honing and has a rubber cap that safely covers the point when the rod in-between uses. There is a color-coded ring at the end for hanging the steel up and also for quickly identifying the grit size among a collection of DMT sharpeners of varying grits. DMT generously vows to replace any product found to be defective free of charge. --Cristina Vaamonde

The Thule 822XT Bed-Rider Fork Mount Carrier transforms your truck bed into a fork mount bike carrier for easy, convenient and secure transport. Designed for two bicycles of any size of kind, this carrier utilizes a combination of telescoping bar technology and easy-to-install Thule Low Rider Fork Blocks with fork clamping skewers that quickly and securely attach to bikes via the dropouts exposed along their front forks when the front tire is removed. Additional features include: the ability to both lock bikes to the carrier and the carrier to the truck bed with additional lock cylinders, compatibility with full size and small pick-up beds and tool-free installation.

The Thule 822XT Bed-Rider Carrier is a fork mount bike carrier that is designed to quickly transform your truck bed into a mobile 2-bike rack that can be expanded to transport even more bikes as the need arises. Built around a telescoping bed bar, the Thule 822XT Bed-Rider Fork Mount Carrier features virtually tool-free installation with no drilling or bolting required and utilizing only an included tamper-proof wrench for its quick installation.

The telescoping bed bar of the Thule 822XT Bed Rider Fork Mount Carrier extends out to fit almost any size truck bed, large or small, with the furthest points of the bar capped with perpendicular angled rail feet. To attain a firm hold the bar is placed near the front of the bed, but not flush against it, with the rail feet resting along the edge of the side walls of the bed, but not overly tight. Next, with the cam handle clamp at one end of the bar open, the middle portion of the bar is rotated, which extends the bar tightly against the truck side walls on both sides. Once firmly in place the cam handle can be clamped shut and locked using a lock option installed in the handle. This secures the entire carrier to the truck bed. Once the bar is securely in place any remaining lock cylinders should be installed into the two low rider fork blocks. (Additional lock cylinders may need to be purchased to secure the cam handle clamp and the two Low Rider Fork Blocks) The Low Rider Fork Blocks, with the fork clamping skewers running through them, are then attached directly to the bed bar using the included tamper-free wrench. Bikes are mounted to the Low Rider Forks Blocks via your bikes' front fork dropouts exposed when their front tires are removed and stowed in the the trunk bed. Once clamped into place by the skewer running through the blocks, bikes can be locked to the carrier with the lock embedded in the Low Rider Block.

Thule will warranty all Thule brand car rack systems and its accessories manufactured by Thule during the time that an original retail purchaser owns the product. This warranty terminates if a purchaser transfers the product to any other person. No warranty is given for defects caused by normal wear and tear, cosmetic rust, scratches, accidents, unlawful vehicle operation, or modification of, or any types of repair of a load carrier system other than those authorized by Thule.

Thule was founded in 1942 by the Thulin family, when Eric Thulin, a true lover of the outdoors, put the Thule name on a pike trap he designed and began to sell in Scandinavia. It wasn't long before he added other practical items to the company's portfolio. By the 1960s, the company began to concentrate on car-related products, including its first roof rack. The Thulin family sold Thule to the publicly listed company Eldon in 1979, and it has continued to grow both organically and through acquisitions ever since. The Thule Group is a world leader in providing transport solutions for an active life.

No tool belt should be without its very own Victorinox Swiss Army SwissTool. The SwissTool was designed for ease of use, but doesn't compromise on durability or functionality. Individual springs hold the tools in place so you can easily access each one individually from the outside of the handle. The lock and release system is designed to lock each tool in place when opened, and release to fold away with a simple slide of the release button.

The SwissTool is truly a handyperson's helper with a multitude of implements and available accessories; it's at your service when it's at your side. From lightweight design to its outside opening implements, there's not much the SwissTool can't do. 

Like all Swiss Army Knives, the SwissTool has a lifetime warranty, stainless steel implements and Swiss-made quality and durability.

Includes 27 Functions:

History and Heritage
In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers’ union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer’s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as “inoxydable"" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.

Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.

Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives
The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.

Sharpening
To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15°– 20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.

Cleaning
After you’ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.



From the renowned company that created the Swiss Army knife a century ago comes the SwissTool Spirit folding multi-tool, a handy tool kit neatly contained within a folding body that measures just 4.13 inches long. The SwissTool Spirit is sheathed in a sleek stainless-steel body that stores comfortably in a leather belt pouch. More importantly, the SwissTool Spirit offers 27 functions, with such mini-tools as needle-nose pliers; 2mm, 3mm, and 6mm screwdrivers; a wire cutter; a bottle opener; a crate opener; a combi-edge blade; scissors; a metal file; a metal saw; a wood saw; a reamer; a Phillips screwdriver; a chisel/scraper; an isolation length cutter; a wire bender; a wire stripper; a wire scraper/round cutter; a can opener; a multipurpose hook; a coupling for a corkscrew; a hardwire cutter; 10 individual springs; and a lock release.

As with all Victorinox items, the SwissTool Spirit is made to exacting standards, with dozens of steps going into its construction. Victorinox attends to every detail, from selecting the finest materials to performing the final inspection. In addition, each individual tool has been hardened in a different way to stand up to its designated use. The SwissTool Spirit--which comes with a lanyard hole and a leather pouch--weighs 5.75 ounces and carries a lifetime warranty.

About Victorinox
In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

About Columbia Sportswear
Founded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of ski-wear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.

Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that, it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60-year-old Gert began her role as ""Mother Boyle"" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.

The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.

668,"A favorite among folks nostalgic for the Wild West, this Lodge Logic cast-iron country kettle is the perfect serving vessel for soup, stew, and chili. The kettle holds up to 1 pint of liquid and measures 5 inches across and 2-1/2 inches deep, making it suitable for a single serving of stew or as a container for warm dips or sauces. Much of its appeal stems from its cast-iron construction, which not only looks authentic (think cowboys sitting around a campfire), but keeps its contents warm far longer than comparable aluminum, ceramic, or stainless containers. The kettle also comes with a trio of integral legs for stability and a wire bail handle for easy transport. As with all Lodge Logic items, the kettle is preseasoned through a proprietary ""electrostatic"" vegetable oil spray system. The preseasoning process readies the kettle for serving right out of the box, making it far more convenient than old-style cast-iron accessories that required oil and oven seasoning before use. The timesaving process also generates a nonstick finish that helps preserve the cookware for generations while crafting an attractive heirloom appearance. Lodge recommends hand washing the kettle with a stiff brush and hot water for best results. The kettle comes with a lifetime warranty.

About Victorinox
In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

With the watch attached to your wrist, grip the bezel at the three o'clock and nine o'clock points and slowly twist counterclockwise.

The pliers have integrated wire cutters for flush cuts through a wide variety of gauges. A fine-edge blade with a pinpoint tip, uncommon in most multi-tools, ensures long-lasting sharpness and is great for detailed cutting applications. Where most multi-tool drivers tend to loosen up over time, the Winchesters cross-head screwdriver stands up to plenty of torque for driving larger screws. A medium-size, flathead screwdriver with bottle opener easily cracks open refreshments on the go. As though these fine implements werent enough, the Winchester also includes: a serrated knife, a large flat head screwdriver, a can opener, a small flat head screwdriver, and an awl with a filean impressive array thatd normally require packing along a second multi-tool, but one thats organized and easily accessible with this single, lightweight unit. --Brian D.

About Speedo
In 1914, Speedo was founded in Australia by Alexander MacRae, a 22-year-old Scottish immigrant who arrived in the country in 1910. The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills. A naming competition was held by the staff in 1928 and won by a Captain Parsonson, who coined the slogan, ""Speed on in your Speedos."" In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didnt take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself. World War II caused the brand turn over 90% of its manufacturing to war production, providing the armed services with vital equipment such as mosquito nets. After the war, Speedo opened a new factory and was able to re-establish itself, due to increased demand for swimsuits. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd, was incorporated and became a publicly traded company on the Sydney Stock exchange.

Speedo hit the international stage in earnest, at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games, and a few years later the brand grew on a more global scale. Export sales to the USA began and an international division was set up to monitor trade in New Zealand, Japan and South Africa. The expansion of the brand continued, and in 1976, Speedo was appointed as the official swimwear for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, where 52 out of 54 countries wore their swimsuits.

Speedo continues to make its mark in the pool and on the beach today. Many world class athletes who wear Speedo include U.S. phenomenon Michael Phelps, legendary Australian swimmer Grant Hackett, world record holder Kosuke Kitajima from Japan, and Hollands Inge de Bruijn.

About Everlast
The name Everlast is synonymous with boxing. Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910. Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name, Everlast. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.

Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the worlds heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50% of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the familys remaining 50% interest. Nadorf remained the President and Principle Share Holder of Everlast until October 24, 2000.

Everlast mens and womens apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states. Everlast has a traditional past and a knockout future.

About Columbia Sportswear
Founded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of ski-wear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.

Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that, it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60-year-old Gert began her role as ""Mother Boyle"" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.

The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.

Selecting a Tent
Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Expect the Worst
In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.

Three- and Four-Season Tents
For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.

For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.

Domes and Tunnels
Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.

Size Matters
Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.

Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

You aim at a fixed point (target or Bulls eye) and carefully fire a 3-5 shot group. You have now established the point of impact versus the point of aim. Now clamp the gun in the vise and use the adjustments on the vise to center the reticle (Red dot or crosshairs) on the point of aim (target). without moving the gun or vise use the adjustments on the sight to move the reticle to the center of the group. You have just mechanically and optically aligned the points of aim and impact, I.E .you're on target.

900,"Some models available with BDC reticle (bullet drop compensating) Guaranteed waterprooof, fogproof and shockproof.

The Nikon 6452 4.5 to 14 x 40 Buckmasters side-focus Nikoplex matte riflescope is a rugged, waterproof, shockproof and fogproof scope. Put through an advanced vacuum process that removes virtually all air and water molecules, the scope's tube is then filled with nitrogen and O-ring sealed. This process ensures that the Nikon 6452 will perform under the most stringent of field conditions without suffering any effects of fogging or condensation.

The precision-ground and polished optical glass is coated with Nikon's exclusive Brightvue coating that allows 92 percent light transmission, giving you super clarity and high resolution. Positive, audible, manual 0.25 MOA (Minute of Angle) windage and elevation adjustments eliminate reticle creep or backlash. The Nikon 6452 features Nikon's specially designed Nikoplex reticle that is composed of a thick outer crosshair that steps down to a finer crosshair at the center. This feature leads your eye to the point of focus and allows for quick, easy targeting. This scope also features Nikon's side-focus parallax adjustment for even greater targeting ease. Just set the adjustment at the distance you will be shooting from and your targeting will be clear and accurate.

The Nikon 6452 features an adjustable 4.5x to 14x magnification and a large, 40 millimeter objective lens diameter, giving the scope an exit pupil size of 8.9 to 2.9 millimeters, depending on magnification. A 4.5x magnification setting on this scope makes the image appear four and a half times larger than with the eye alone, with an exit pupil of 8.9 millimeters. At the 14x magnification setting, the exit pupil would be reduced to 2.9 millimeters. The Nikon 6452 is a full-sized scope with an adjustable magnification and exit pupil, making it an excellent choice for low light targeting as well as long distance targeting in full light.

About Exit Pupil Size
The size of the exit pupil for a riflescope is determined by dividing the objective lens diameter by the magnification rating. The human eye pupil diameter ranges from 2 to 7 millimeters, depending on the amount of light. For proper light gathering potential, the diameter of the scope's exit pupil must be equal to or greater than the diameter of your eye pupil at the light level you will be using the scope. If you're working in low light, your exit pupil size will be of greater importance. With an adjustable 8.9 to 2.9 millimeter exit pupil, the Nikon 6452 4.5 to 14 x 40 Buckmasters side-focus Nikoplex matte riflescope is an excellent choice for hunting in low light or long distance hunting in full light.

The Petzl E46 PC2 TacTikka 3-LED headlamp is compact and lightweight and comes equipped with red and white lighting with flip filter for easy transition.  The red filter helps to preserve night vision. With three LEDs and a single lighting level it is simple to use and provides powerful lighting with ample burn time. Its beam is adjustable and can be aimed in any desired direction.  The Petzl E46 PC2 TacTikka 3-LED headlamp has an easy to adjust headband, making this a comfortable headlamp to wear.

909,"The TacTikka Plus is a tactical version of the popular TikkaPlus headlamp. It uses 4 LEDs and push button technology, has tiltable housing, 3 brightness settings, and current regulation for when battery power runs down. It also features a red flipdown lens for night vision, and includes 3 AAA batteries for up to 150 hours of burn time.

While this headlamp is designed specifically for night fishing, it could just as easily be used for other purposes, such as night hiking, camping, climbing, or even hunting.

The TacTikka Plus is lightweight (78 g with batteries) and comfortable to wear, which is a good thing, since you're likely to be using it over longer stretches of time. Another great feature of the LED bulbs is that they are much more impact-resistant than incandescents: you're really going to have to smack it hard against something before you lose your illumination. Plus, LEDs are extremely energy-efficient. According to the manufacturer, you'll get functional illumination up to 150 hours on the included batteries, depending on which light levels you operate at.

The TacTikka Plus has three intensity settings, allowing you to customize your lighting to match your needs. The optimum setting illuminates to 23 meters (note that the range will decline slightly over time as you run your batteries down). If you need more vision, you can switch to the maximum setting; if you need to look at a map, use the economic setting. Hunters and fishing enthusiasts will appreciate the pull-down red filter, which renders the light invisible to most game. It even has an emergency strobe if things get ugly.

Overall a handy, well-designed product.--Josh Dettweiler

About Victorinox
In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

About Victorinox
In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

History and Heritage
In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers’ union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer’s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as “inoxydable"""" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.

Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.

Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives
The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.

Sharpening
To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15°– 20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.

Cleaning
After you’ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.

All you have to do is fill the 27-gallon base with water or sand and play.



And players needn't worry about the 44-inch backboard wearing dramatically over time thanks to the UV-protected, high-density polyethylene construction. This sturdy plastic material helps the board resist chipping and cracking while protecting the graphics from fading. Also equipped with a black, powder-coated, three-piece pole, the Lifetime system carries a five-year warranty.

About Lifetime
In the beginning, all the founder of Lifetime Products wanted was a sturdier basketball pole for his backyard. With this in mind, he found and purchased a piece of heavy-duty used pipe, a sheet of plywood, and a basketball rim. The resulting backyard basketball standard functioned perfectly in his backyard. Seeing the potential of his hoop, he placed an ad in the local free classified newspaper and made his first sale. The rest--as they say--is history. He created the American PlayWorld Company in 1973, based out of his garage in Riverdale, Utah. After expanding into several other types of playground equipment, he eventually moved to a bigger location in South Ogden, Utah. Several years later, the company transformed the basketball industry by introducing the Quick Adjust basketball pole, the first complete basketball system you could raise and lower with a broomstick. In 1986, American PlayWorld created Lifetime Products, a separate company intended to concentrate specifically on manufacturing adjustable basketball systems. In the ensuing years, the company has grown from having 18 employees in a 32,000-square-foot space in half a warehouse to more than 1,400 employees and 2.6 million square feet over 23 separate buildings.

With bulging eyes, holographic finish, and blazing color, it puts fish at your mercy. The uniqueness of this bait is that it doesn’t fall or hang straight down like other bucktails. It glides through the water, almost swimming along. When jigged, its body stays almost parallel to the bottom maintaining a very natural appearance. Like all SPRO products, Prime Bucktail Jigs are made with durable, super sharp Gamakatsu hooks. Once you fish it, you’ll know why SPRO is the shape of things to come. It’s hard to fish the Prime Bucktail wrong. It can be jigged off the bottom for weakfish, fluke, or other saltwater fish. Cast it at schooling fish working it quickly back to the boat for cobia, stripers, snook, or dolphin. Swim it along in freshwater for big bass and walleyes, or troll it for reservoir stripers.

936,"For over 30 years, the Katadyn Pocket Microfilter has been the top choice water filter for emergency preparedness, professional-use and militaries globally. Engineered with the highest quality construction; it can handle the most rugged conditions. The 0.2 micron silver-impregnated ceramic filter element can lasts an impressive 50,000 liter, depending on water quality.

Water treatment products are in high demand for outdoor enthusiasts, international travelers, and relief agencies. Few are better for long-lasting continuous use, however, than the Katadyn Pocket water microfilter. Made of heavy-duty materials, the Pocket features a silver-impregnated ceramic element that's effective against bacteria and protozoa even in extreme conditions. Unlike disposable filters, the ceramic element can be cleaned several times, even in the field. More importantly, the element filters all microorganisms larger than 0.2 microns (0.0002mm), producing clear, drinkable water no matter where in the world you are. The pump also includes an improved, round pump handle for better ergonomics and an outlet hose that attaches to water containers with a single clip.

The Pocket hails from Katadyn's Endurance series, a high-quality line of filters that produce up to 100 times more water than standard water filters. The Pocket is so tough, in fact, that it's the first choice for extreme adventurers like Mike Horn. Plus, it's the only water filter with a 20-year warranty. Other features include a measuring gauge that indicates when you should change the filtering element, a cushioned base that makes it easy to pump on all surfaces, a prefilter, and a carrying bag.

Why Water Filtration Is Important
The World Health Organization (WHO) attributes 80 percent of all travel diseases to contaminated drinking water. Drinking water contains three groups of pathogenic microorganisms: viruses, such as hepatitis A, Norwalk virus, or poliovirus; bacteria, like e-coli, salmonella, and cholera; and protozoans, such as giardia and cryptosporidium. Tap water and ice cubes are usually the culprits when traveling, but even bottled water can be questionable. The backcountry is also a source of waterborne illness. A pristine stream may be safe one day and contaminated the next, as microorganisms stemming from human and animal waste are typically spread by rain and runoff. As a result, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treating water from every source in the backcountry.

Fill the upper compartment with up to 2. 5 gallons of untreated water, and it literally drips through the 0. 2 micron ceramic filter elements into the bottom compartment. Simply set it on a counter in the corner and keep it filled. The Katadyn Ceradyn water filter is the way to go for cabins, base camps, recreation sites, boats or RV's. The Ceradyn comes with three ceramic filter elements (it uses all 3) which will treat up to an incredible 150, 000 Liters of water

The Katadyn TRK Drip Ceradyn free-standing gravity filter features a 10 liter water container for large quantities of water. It's ideal for the water supply for camps, cabins and homes without running water. This Ceradyn version comes with three ceramic filter elements.

Ceramic filters have a micro porous structure with impregnated silver which delays the growth of bacteria. The pore-size of Katadyn ceramic filters is 0.2 micron (0.0002 mm). Bacteria range in size from 0.2 to 5 micron and, like protozoa (1 to 15 micron), are efficiently filtered out. Ceramic filters can be mechanically regenerated and the filter capacity is measurable.

From Backpackgeartest.org
The Katadyn Base Camp filter is a gravity feed filter system that utilizes a bag that is filled with unfiltered water, hung, and allows gravity to feed the water through the filter media into a water container. It is one of Katadyn's Backcountry Series of filters.

Initial Impressions
The Katadyn Base Camp filter arrived at my home packaged in an attractive display box. The box contained the filter bag, filter cartridge, lock ring for filter cartridge, hose, hose valve, and a small plastic bag containing the instruction book, a small tube of silicone lubricant, and a sponge.

My initial impression of the product, based solely on its appearance and packaging, was that it seemed to be an attractive and well-designed unit. The bag is similar in construction to a dry bag (a nylon material coated on the inside, with a top that rolls down and buckles to close). The bag has a plastic insert at the bottom to accept the filter. I find the bright blue color to be attractive, and feel it strikes a good balance between being unobtrusive during an outdoor experience, yet still bright enough that I'm unlikely to lose it by not noticing I left it in camp. A close examination of the bag revealed what appears to me to be soundly welded seams in the bag, good stitching where the straps and buckles are located, and a well-constructed unit.

The filter itself is a pleated material (much like an air filter in a car) mounted in an otherwise plastic cylinder. The manufacturer's website describes this filter material as a glass fiber. Over the pleated surface was wrapped what the manufacturer refers to as a filter protector (a very fine mesh screen) that is held on by a cylinder of plastic mesh. The filter and filter protector seem to be constructed in keeping with the simple design of the unit as a whole.

The shutoff valve is a simple plastic clip that slides over the discharge hose, and can be pinched to stop the flow, or released to allow filtration.

Reading the Instructions
The instruction manual was very straightforward, with good line drawings and text explanations. There are two omissions I noticed. First was the lack of an explanation surrounding the installation and operation of the hose valve, though I found this to be self-explanatory. The second omission was any explanation of the purpose of the sponge provided, though I have been told it is for cleaning the filter protector. Instructions were included in English and French, and covered product set-up, normal operation, field performance tips, long-term storage, cartridge capacity, replacement cartridge installation, product registration, and warranty information (along with basic information on water filtration).

In the field performance tips section the manual describes how to temporarily clean the filter cartridge in the field should it become clogged, a process I hope to try out while testing this product.

In addition to the manual, there is a label titled ""Important Field Tips"" sewn to the top of the bag that provides 6 line drawings that explain how to assemble and use the filter.

At the manufacturer's website additional information is found in the Frequently Asked Questions section. In this section I found several helpful tips, including allowing sediment to settle out of water in another container prior to filtering it, and wrapping a bandana or similar item around the filter cartridge to extend its life when filtering very dirty water.

Trying it out
I found assembly of the filter to be fairly straightforward. While at first I didn't think I would need to use the silicone lubricant to insert the cartridge into the plastic insert in the bag, I quickly realized I would need to. After lubricating the o-ring, the cartridge slid in with moderate effort. Insertion of the hose onto the filter barb took a couple of tries, as the filter barb is recessed into the base of the filter between four flanges, and I have big fingers. I found the silicone lubricant to be helpful here as well. Once these tasks were completed, I simply threaded the plastic lock ring (that prevents the filter from simply falling out) onto the flange and slipped on the hose valve and the filter was ready for use.

One note on assembly is that there is a warning in the instructions not to grasp the cartridge around the pleated surface or it could become damaged. This warning made me wonder how much caution will be required in my pack, as the filter cartridge is essentially unprotected from crushing. This is something I will monitor during field testing. Once the filter was assembled, I decided to try it out in my kitchen. The first thing I realized was that filling the bag isn't as easy as I thought it would be with one person. Even at my sink, trying to hold the bag with one hand and fill with the other was a challenge. The bag flipped closed at one point, causing the water to flow down the front of my pants. Once I figured out how to hold it to prevent that from happening, I realized the bag gets pretty heavy as it fills. I plan to try filling the filter on the ground during field testing to see if that is easier. I also wonder how realistic it will be to fill the bag directly from, for example, a lake while keeping the discharge hose out of the unfiltered water, at least by myself.

The next challenge became finding a place to hang the filter, for which I chose the back of a chair. Due to the bag being barely above the outlet end of the hose the flow was very slow, but it did confirm the operation of the filter and confirmed there were no leaks. The flow valve was easy to close and seemed to lock very securely. The valve released okay, but my big fingers made releasing a little more difficult.

I followed the instructions to filter 2 L (2.1 qt) of water to flush the filter of carbon. While the instructions noted that this water might be discolored, I wasn't expecting the first flow to be black. The carbon quickly cleared, however.

The water filtered after this initial flush was clear. I conducted a side-by-side taste test between my unfiltered tap water and the filtered tap water. There was a slight, but detectable, improvement in the filtered water's taste, which I suspect was the result of the carbon in the filter absorbing residual chlorine from my tap water.

Testing Strategy
I plan to test the filter by using it to filter all my water for the trips I take during the test period, save what I carry in at the trailhead. I am a heavy consumer of water while backpacking. Since I will be providing water for up to four people on many of my trips, this filter will see a great deal of use during the test period, likely filtering in excess of 50 gallons (189 L) of water from a broad variety of sources.

Throughout the testing I will work to evaluate the following areas:

Summary
Overall the Katadyn Base Camp filter appears to be a well-constructed, well-designed filter. I look forward to evaluating its performance under real-world conditions.

User Features

When using the scissors, you'll first grip the handles at the thicker ends and swing them open. At first you will notice a bit of resistance, due to the spring mechanism that controls the scissors. To close them, simply reverse the procedure.

To navigate the blades, just open the handles. Then it's easy to use the nail nick to rotate out a single blade. Once the blade is open, all you have to do is close both handles to take advantage of the Posi-Stop feature. Should a blade accidentally start to close, that blade will be stopped by the opposite handle -- for an added measure of strength and safety. For further stability, the Micra has two small tabs inside the handles that interlock when the handles are closed.

The Micra comes with a stainless steel split ring that will allow the tool to be attached to any key chain or lanyard. Or, if you prefer, the split ring can be completely removed and the fixed attachment point can be easily folded inside the tool.

Reps and sets are a way to track training progress. This is a general guide, and programs will vary depending on your specific needs, goals, and experience.

Proper Form:

When trying movements for the first time, use lighter resistance with the goal of being able to perform all movements without breaking form. Multiple bands can be used for added resistance. Do not push through or ignore aches and pains as you perform any movement.

Progressive Resistance:

Progressive resistance is a concept that states you should be able to lift more weight or do more repetitions each time you perform an exercise. As you progress through any training phase, increase the resistance when your prescribed repetitions decrease. When the prescribed repetitions increase, decrease the resistance accordingly. You may also need to adjust your repetitions, sets, and resistance if you are not seeing improvements towards your goals.

The 72 is one of Pure Energys pro level air systems. This system combines a popular bottle and the top-of-the-line Pure Energy Reactor regulator. The Pure Energy Reactor regulator has a preset output pressure set between 800-900 PSI. This air-system works great with any marker on the market, from Piranhas to Angels. Because Pure Energy Reactor regulators are now re-buildable, this system is one of the most user-friendly, screw-in air systems in paintball. On most markers you can expect to get 700-1100 shots from a full fill. The exemption for Pure Energys carbon fiber bottle means you only have to have it re-hydrotested every five years. With the CFT piston and a streamlined setup, this air system is both extremely consistent over the chronograph and has very little drop off as you shoot the gas out of the tank (life of the fill). These are attributes sometimes found in much more expensive air-systems packaged into a smaller, easier-to-use, screw-in system.

Method of Operation:
Preset screw-in air system

Bottle:
72 cubic inches lightweight aluminum composite

Power Supply:
Compressed air or nitrogen

It combines the best features of stainless steel and coated cleaning rods, then adds valuable properties of its own. the carbon fiber can't scratch your bore like stainless steel, and they won't embed like coated rods. Plus, Carbon Fiber rods can be bent to an extreme degree and return to their original straightness. We call these cleaning rods ""deluxe"" because they feature an ergonomically designed handle that spins on two sets of ball bearings - the result is a cleaning rod that smoothly follows the rifling both pushing and pulling, even while under pressure. The ""shank-through"" construction also allows the user to apply ""reasonable"" hammer blows to the end of the cleaning rod to get a tight patch through a bore.

Renowned as a master of knives and tools, Gerber's problem-solving, life-saving products are designed with the unique needs of specific activities in mind. Today that includes much more than a blade.

This knife is as adaptable as the personnel who carry it. Use it to cut through the skin of a fuselage. Or sever a seat belt. Or egress through the Plexiglas of a chopper. Plus, the LMF II does a slick job cutting firewood and building shelter. The over-molded handle successfully limits blistering. There is complete separation between the tang and butt cap, so the knife absorbs the shocks from hammering and prevents the shocks of electricity. Smartly situated grooves and lashing holes let the LMF II convert to a spear. The low-profile sheath facilitates movement, limits noise, works for parachuting, and attaches to a belt or Molle vest. The patented, integrated sharpener means edge retention in the field.

About Swiss Army Knives
In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

1085,"The SOG Specialty Knives & Tools TF5-CP Trident is a unique, versatile and fast opening folding knife that provides many different uses, while showcasing SOG’s style and quality construction. Made of AUS-8 steel with an attractive hardcase copper TiNi finish, the 3.75-inch partially serrated, folding blade has a clip point shape that allows a quicker and deeper puncture upon insertion, sharpens easily and makes quick work of any task. SOG Assisted Technology (S.A.T.) works through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs. As you initiate the opening action, the force propelling your blade open becomes greater than the force keeping it closed. The result is a blade that springs open instantly once it is engaged, seemingly on its own. The piston locking mechanism uses a movable bar that's wedged between the blade tang and knife handle to lock the blade in place while in the open position. The ergonomically contoured and well-balanced handle has a desert digital camo finish and is made of a high strength, abrasion and impact resistant glass-reinforced nylon that will fit comfortably in your hand. The Digi-Grip variable pattern provides a secure, no-slip grip and the base of the handle sports a groove that allows the user to cut paracord, fishing line and other cord-sized objects without having to open the blade. The reversible belt clip provides a low and discrete carry for right and left handed users or can be removed for pouch storage. The TF5-CP has a closed length of 4.75-inches, overall length of 8.5-inches, blade thickness of 0.13-inches and weighs 3.6-ounces. The SOG TF5-CP Trident Knife comes with a limited lifetime warranty. Each SOG product is created with the help of company founder and chief engineer, Spencer Frazer. Known for their uncompromising style and performance, these knives and tools showcase innovation, dependability and a unique, futuristic style that has garnered awards and recognition worldwide.

Blending elements from the Bowie, Tomcat, SEAL Pup, and Flash Series knives, SOG Specialty Knives and Tools has created a new breed of folding knife: the TF-5 Desert Camo Trident Knife with partially-serrated blade and copper TiNi coating. Designed for use by Navy SEALs, the TF-5 features SOG's grooved handle, which allows you to cut heavy cord and cable without having to open the specially designed blade. The TF-5's blade is easy to open and features Arc-Actuator technology, which helps the blade lock more strongly and release more easily.



S.A.T. knives offer security and peace of mind with their locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access than other knives'. For Trident Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be quickly released with a sliding button. An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed, and for easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to be opened.

Cryogenic Heat Treatment and TiNi Coating Guarantee a Sharp, Durable Blade
The TF-5 offers a full, 3.75-inch, AUS8 stainless steel blade that has undergone SOG's patented Cryogenic Heat Treatment process, which ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly reducing the blade's temperature to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then slowly heating the blade to room temperature. The stress created by this process strengthens the steel on an atomic level and increases the blade's overall durability and edge retention.

In addition to having undergone the Cryogenic Heat Treatment Process, this knife was coated in proprietary titanium nitride (TiNi), of the toughest coatings that can be applied to steel. TiNi boasts extreme hardness, is exceptionally scratch and peel resistant, helps increase steel's longevity, and ensures low reflectivity.

Ergonomic, Lightweight Design Ensures Comfortable Use
Even if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make precise cuts if your knife doesn't fit comfortably in your hand. That's why this knife's handle is ergonomically contoured. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle is well-balanced and features SOG's unique Digi-Grip texturing, a feature that gives you gripping power where you need it most. Additionally, SOG's grooved handle allows you to cut heavy cord and cable without having to open the blade.

At just 3.6 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible. The removable clip is easily switched for right/left hand-carry.

This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.

About SOG: Strong, Innovative Specialty Tools
SOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War. SOG Specialty Knives & Tools was founded in the spirit of this elite group and became the first knife manufacturer to offer an expanded line that included fixed blades, folding knives, and multipurpose tools.

Each SOG product is created by company Founder and Chief Engineer, Spencer Frazer. Known for their uncompromising style and performance, these knives and tools showcase innovation, dependability, and a unique, futuristic style that has garnered awards and recognition worldwide. SOG products have also won favor among law enforcement, military, and industrial customers that rely on their tools to perform flawlessly in the toughest, most adverse conditions.

1113,"An Automatic Watch is a mechanical watch that winds itself and does not require a battery. When worn daily, the movement of the wrist causes the mainspring to wind progressively, eliminating the need for additional winding. To start your automatic, you can hand wind it by rotating the crown clockwise a number of turns while in its normal operating position (screw down crowns will need to be unscrewed first), or by swinging it side to side for 30 seconds. We recommend housing an automatic in a watch winder box. Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more. Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors) or manually wind it.

To wind up the main spring: Manual winding - Fully wound up by turning the crown minimum 55 times. Fully wound up by turning the rachet wheel screw 8 times. Machine winding - Rotary speed 30 RPM and operation time 60 minutes

Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

About Coleman
More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.

In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

About Coleman
More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.

In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

Find just the right light with an adjustable knob that allows you to dim the brightness level from its highest at 700 lumens to as low as you need it.

Tired of camping lanterns that burn through batteries like nobody's business? Turn to the Coleman rechargeable lantern, which offers up to nine hours of runtime on a single charge. The family-size lantern features an 11-watt fluorescent spiral U-tube bulb that shines brightly regardless of its locale, with a reflector that directs the light upward and outward so more people can enjoy it.

Most importantly, when the lantern starts to lose power, you can easily recharge the battery via a 120-volt AC outlet or a vehicle's 12-volt DC power port (cords included). That means you can recharge the lantern before leaving on a trip, or you can recharge it at the campsite using your car's lighter port. Other details include an ""emergency on"" circuit that helps overcome power failures, a built-in nightlight, and a recyclable battery. The lantern--which also runs extremely cool to protect against fires--measures 6.75 by 14 by 8 inches (W x H x D) and weighs 7.78 pounds.

Sleep Well: Finding the Right Sleeping Bag
Sleeping bag technology has come a long way from the days of cowboy bedrolls. These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag:

Buy for Cold
It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10.

Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for ""warm"" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night.

Goose or No Goose?
The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly and stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use.

All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget.

Bags for All Shapes
Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips.

Pad Yourself
No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

1185,"Here's a great rifle with great power. Includes the Hop-Up system and shoots 0.2g BBs. It has two BB feeding systems. For the fun of motion and action, use the rotary cartridge magazine which holds 5 shells. The shell casing ejects after each shot. Going for the capacity and not the fuss, try the direct feed tube magazine. Super 9 Pro has an increased muzzle velocity of 370fps (1.27J) with a .2g BB and an effective range of 117ft. Rifle is 47 long and uses a magazine feed cartridge for maximum realism. Magazine capacity is 25 rounds for direct feed, or 5 shells (included). This is a spring gun, which means it's powered by a spring and must be cocked for each shot. It's fast, clean, inexpensive and easily maintained; it requires no gas or batteries to operate. Also, spring guns are the toughest, most durable of all airsoft guns, because they're made with few breakable pieces. If you're looking for a fun, reliable airsoft rifle that'll look great and perform even better, you've come to the right place. New generation of airsoft. HOP UP system. Velocity: 420 FPS w/ .12g bbs,~ 370FPS w/ .2g (recommended), 330FPS w/ .25g.

A 1:1 scale replica of a bolt-action rifle, the Super 9 airsoft rifle is remarkably authentic. The airsoft rifle fires round pellets known as BBs, which are propelled out of the gun by a spring mechanism. The advantage of the airsoft rifle, however, is that players can safely train, simulate, or play with the gun without fearing serious injury. The airsoft rifle looks, feels, weighs, and functions just like a real firearm, but is built for casual recreation rather than weaponized use. In fact, the only way you can typically tell a real-steel firearm from an airsoft rifle is the blazing orange tip and the BBs that fire when you pull the trigger. The rifle includes a hop-up system and two different magazine options: a rotary cartridge magazine that holds five shells (the shell casing ejects after each shot) and a direct feed tube magazine. Spring guns are the toughest, most durable of all airsoft guns because they're made with the fewest breakable pieces.

About Planet Bike
Planet Bike was founded in 1996 in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment. Despite being a simple machine, the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. Planet Bike embraces an alternative corporate purpose, which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled by donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage.

Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist, and its goal is to make innovative, high quality, practical bicycle accessories. The company's advancements include a four-line computer which is now a standard in the industry, and the first self-contained HID light. While still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve its product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes.

While both fierce and elegant, the mild S-shaped pattern of the Blur blade serves not merely for looks alone. The slight curvature lengthens the edge of the blade and places it at a wider array of angles while performing any cutting motion. Optimize the angle of attack as the S-curve moves more of the blade weight toward the tip of the blade, simultaneously encouraging material to settle into the mid-blade concave curvature. If that were not enough, the featured serration allows it to cut cleanly without shredding and cut fibrous material like rope, webbing and cords. Enhance the power and efficiency of cutting freeing hang rope or game as the concave edge renders the bulk of the material, less likely to pull away from the extended and angular-optimized cutting motion.

1261,"The WaterRower Natural is handcrafted from solid Ash wood, finished with a honey oak stain and danish oil. The WaterRower's patented WaterFlywheel has been specifically designed to emulate the dynamics of a boat moving though water and is unsurpassed in its simulation of the physical and physiological benefits of rowing. WaterRower will not provide support or documentation for any product transported outside of the original country of purchase

Rowing has long been recognized as the perfect aerobic pursuit, with naturally smooth and flowing movements that don't tax the joints but do boost the heart rate. Now you can take your rowing experience to the next level with the WaterRower Natural rowing machine. Using the same principles that govern the dynamics of a boat in water, the WaterRower Natural is outfitted with a ""water flywheel"" that consists of two paddles in an enclosed tank of water that provide smooth, quiet resistance, just like the paddles in an actual body of water. As a result, the machine has no moving parts that can wear out over time (even the recoil belt and pulleys don't require lubricating or maintaining). More significantly, the water tank and flywheel create a self-regulating resistance system that eliminates the need for a motor. As with real rowing, when you paddle faster, the increased drag provides more resistance. When you paddle slower, the resistance is less intense. The only limit to how fast you can row is your strength and your ability to overcome drag. And unlike conventional rowing machines, which tend to be jerky and jarring, the WaterRower Natural is remarkably smooth and fluid.

From a fitness perspective, the WaterRower Natural works 84 percent of your muscle mass, helping tone and strengthen your muscles while burning far more calories than most other aerobic machines. The exercise is also low impact, as it removes all the body weight from the ankles, knees, and hips, but still moves the limbs and joints through a full range of motion--from completely extended to completely contracted.

The WaterRower Natural is outfitted with a Series 4 performance monitor that's designed to balance technical sophistication with user-friendliness. The monitor--which includes six information and programming windows, six QuickSelection buttons, and three navigation buttons--displays your workout intensity, stroke rate, heart rate, zone bar, duration, and distance. Plus, the monitor is compatible with an optional heart rate chest strap and receiver, which helps you optimize your workout and achieve your exercise objectives.

The WaterRower Natural is handcrafted in solid ash and stained honey oak for consistency of color. The wood was chosen due to its marvelous engineering properties, especially its ability to absorb sound and vibration, which enhances the WaterRower's quiet performance and smooth operation. Ash, like all woods used in the construction of the WaterRower, is a premium hardwood with incredible longevity and dimensional stability. In addition, the wood is harvested from replenishable forests and is hand finished with Danish oil to provide a deep luster.

Other details include dual rails with four corner wheels that increase seat stability and reduce the amount of sweat buildup; a frame that flips upright for handy storage; and a weight capacity of up to 1,000 pounds. The WaterRower Natural measures 84 by 21 by 22 inches (W x H x D), weighs 117 pounds (with water), and carries a one-year warranty on the frame and components (WaterRower will upgrade the warranty to five years on the frame and three years on the components with the completion of a registration form).

1263,"PowerBlock sport 24 adjustable dumbbell replaces 8 pairs of dumbbells in the space of just 1 pair. Sport 24 has a weight range of 3-24 lbs. Per hand in 3 lb. increments, replacing 216 lbs. of free weights. Compact design keeps workout space neat & organized. Weight changes take just seconds using a selector pin much like a weight stack machine at the gym. Selector Pin: Simple and efficient. Insert the magnetic polypropylene pin into the slot to select the desired weight. The pin has a 500 lbs. max load. Auto Lock: EXP models have an 'Auto-Lock' to make micro adjustments by reducing the handle weight by 2.5 or 5 lbs. The two 2.5 lbs. inside the tubes at the base of the handle can be removed by pulling on the lever. Bands on the side rails show the weight of the dumbbell selected with the pin. The pin covers the band/rail that's been selected to easily show what the weight is.

The only dumbbell system that can expand to meet your strength needs, PowerBlock dumbbells are the most versatile and effective exercise tool ever developed for strength training. PowerBlocks work intuitively. Rather than requiring you to buy a room full of dumbbells, PowerBlocks act just like a weight stack at the gym, with a weight handle that fits inside the first weight, which fits inside the second, which fits inside the third, etc. When you want to change weights, you simply move the weight selector pin into the appropriate slot and you're set. As you lift the core, all the weights above the selector pin are lifted at the same time, turning your 3-pound dumbbell into a 6-pound dumbbell, or your 6-pound dumbbell into a 12-pound dumbbell. Not only is the system remarkably easy to use, but it's also cost- and space-efficient, as a single pair of dumbbells can do the work of dozens.

This pair of SportBlock 24x3 dumbbells, for instance, adjusts from 3 to 24 pounds in 3-pound increments (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 pounds), in effect doing the job of 16 individual weights. Even better, the weights are more compact and balanced than traditional dumbbells, with a padded handle that protects people with weak wrists. Best of all, the free weights are terrific whether you're trying to build muscle mass, firm and tone your physique, or get rid of unwanted body fat. The SportBlock set offers a maximum weight of 24 pounds per hand and carries a limited 10-year warranty.

They also seal the threads against leakage, preventing rust and corrosion.

Trac Your Progress
Perfect for the fit-focused who have more motivation than workout space, the Stamina BodyTrac Glider is the compact, portable rowing machine that fits into any area and easily stands on end for storing between workouts. The BodyTrac Glider features full-range-of-motion rowing arms to allow a natural rowing movement, optimizing the proven benefits rowing provides the entire body. Because rowing is an incredibly efficient, low-impact aerobic exercise that naturally targets major muscle groups, the 23.5"" x 46"" BodyTrac Glider lets you strengthen and tighten your back, legs, arms, abdominals and glutes using a single machine.

Lasting Comfort for Longer Workouts

1352,"The Pinon Sport Dome is 49 square feet, sleeping 2-3 people. Lightweight enough for hiking and traveling anywhere you go. 7' x 7' x 50"" is a square shape dome providing lots of head space.

Nicely lightweight and easy to set up and breakdown, the sporty Wenzel Pinon dome-style tent is a great choice for a weekend car camping outing. It features a generously sized single room that measures 7 by 7 feet--great for storing lots of gear--and a 50-inch maximum height. In addition to the good-sized D-style door (with a mesh window covering half of it), this tent also includes a window on the back for cross-current ventilation. The interior is quite spare, with only a small gear pocket in one corner near the door.

Setting up the tent was easy, for the most part, and we erected the tent (with its two shock-corded fiberglass poles) in under five minutes. The one impediment to an even faster assembly was the heavy-duty nylon corner pockets that secure the poles, which included a polyester-reinforced interior flap that's not seamed at the top of the entry. Thus, we had a tougher time than we should have trying to make correct purchase with the pocket, continually hitting the space between the nylon pocket and the interior poly pocket.

But we could forgive this slight design flaw for such a nicely light and easily backpacked tent. This tent also includes a fly that offers a good coverage area, including a bit of an extended cover over the door and back window. While we didn't have rain during our testing, we did use a sprinkler for an extended period, and were pleased to note that the fly ably handled the water run off, guiding it away from the bottom of the tent. To improve this tent's weather resistance, it's recommended that you use seam sealer to coat all exposed seams, applying only to the underside of the fly and inside the seams of the tent.

Overall, the Wenzel Pinon is a good choice for car campers and for the occasional hiked excursion. While it won't stand up to the worst that Mother Nature can throw your way, it should handle a decent amount of rain. And its ample 49 square foot interior will hold two good-sized adults and a good amount of gear. --Agen G.N. Schmitz

Amazon.com Tent Guide
Selecting a Tent
Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Expect the Worst
In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.

Three- and Four-Season Tents
For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.

For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.

Domes and Tunnels
Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.

Size Matters
Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.

Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

This works out well for both heath and planet bike since he directs product development and takes every opportunity to indulge in product field testing. Heath comes to planet bike with 12 years in the bicycle industry; dabbling in everything from sales to national bicycle advocacy work, product development to working in a shop and building trail. Cycling has always been a big part of my life starting with my first bike, a 16 inch fixed wheel bike my dad retrieved from a muddy River bed, says heath. Whether it's hitting the trail, going to work, or going to the grocery store, sustainability and my impact on the environment are top priorities for me. I'm proud to be a part of planet bike where these priorities are both shared, and promoted.

In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment.

Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact.

Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

Whether you are training for a race, using a stationary bike for daily fitness, or just want to know your mileage for weekend rides or commuting, the Planet Bike Protege 9.0 9-Function Bike Computer is the perfect, easy-to-operate computer for multiple uses. A must have for any gadget enthusiast or anyone who is data driven, the Protege 9.0 allows you to track your progress and improvement as you build strength through multiple functions as well as view the temperature and time on one easy-to-read screen. Small enough to fit nicely on your handle bars, but large enough to read clearly, the Protege 9.0 provides all the information you need in a sleek and elegant form.

The Protege 9.0 has a ""buttonless"" design that allows for a large Macromonitor LCD screen with most of the information displayed on one very readable page. Displaying four lines of information on one screen, the computer provides up to five pieces of data at once without you even needing to press a button. Switching displays only requires a simple tap on the computer, making it is easy to operate in the midst of your ride, even with gloves on. A longer tap on the computer will reset the data. The functions include current speed, speed comparator, ride time, trip distance, dual odometer (for two wheel sizes), average speed, maximum speed, clock, and temperature for up to two different bikes.

The Protege 9.0 makes it easy for you to record and track your trip information effortlessly as you ride. The computer auto-starts when your bike begins moving, and mileage and time stop recording when you stop and restart automatically when you begin again so you can get an accurate reading of your time and distance no matter how many times you stop.

The Protege 9.0 has a two bike capability, allowing you to set the wheel circumference for two different wheel sizes so you can preset odometer readings for both. A single button on the back of the computer allows you to toggle between bikes. An additional wire/sensor harness is all that is needed to use the computer on two different bikes. The computer itself is removable from the holder it sits in and easily switches between bikes.

Built to last, the Protege 9.0 is backed by a lifetime warranty. It comes complete with a heavy-duty oversized wire harness with an 82-centimeter wire mounting kit for the front wheel and a case. The device is ultrasonically welded to be completely weatherproof. Installation is simple with easy-to-follow directions. Combining a clear, easy-to-read display, user-friendly operation, and a sturdy design, the Protege 9.0 is an excellent computer for any biker.

The jet black stainless steel watch receives a time calibration signal transmitted from Fort Collins, Colorado, and signal reception is possible within a radius of about 2,000 miles from the Fort Collins transmitter. You can choose to automatically receive this signal (once per day at 1 AM) or manually update the G-Shock to the atomic clock. It's also solar-powered--charging in either sunlight or indoor light--so you'll never have to deal with changing the battery.

It has a 1/100-second stopwatch with a 24-hour measuring capacity and elapsed time, split time, and 1st/2nd place time modes. It also offers such timekeeping functions as 12/24-hour formats, year/month/date/day display (with an autocalendar to the year 2039), daylight savings time on/off, and world time for 29 time zones and 30 cities. Make it to your next appointment on time with 4 independent daily alarms (with a snooze function) and an optional hourly time signal. This watch offers water resistance to 200 meters (660 feet), suitable for scuba diving. This watch features a durable stainless steel case and strap, scratch-resistant mineral crystal, and AfterGlow LED electro luminescent backlight.







With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.

Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

1518,"Like the men and women who carry our gear, Gerber is Unstoppable. Decades of innovation and dedication have put us here. Renowned as a master of knives and tools, Gerber's problem-solving, life-saving products are designed with the unique needs of specific activities in mind. Today that includes much more than a blade.

The Gerber 05849 AR 3.0 Knife offers a unique combination of function, artistry, and ergonomics. Its heavy-duty construction and one-handed open design combine to create a must-have knife. Complete with a solidly locking blade and soft grip inserts in the handle, the AR 3.0 represents hybrid knife design at its best.



One-Handed Open Technology
Designed to be user friendly, the AR 3.0 can easily be opened with just one hand--an ideal option when you're holding something (like a box, backpack, bag, rope, etc.) in one hand, and the knife in the other. Its mechanics are also silky smooth, so you can shift seamlessly from opening to locking into place to cutting to closing without missing a beat.

Durable Stainless Steel Construction; Comfortable Design
Built from high-quality stainless steel, the AR 3.0 is virtually indestructible. At the same time, it's comfortable to handle and hold thanks to the innovative blend of die-cast aluminum and Softgrip inserts in the handle. For added convenience, the blade is finished in low-glare coating for improved visibility in bright conditions.

Lightweight for Portability
Weighing in at 2.8 ounces with an overall length of only 6.95 inches and blade length of 3 inches, the AR 3.0 provides optimum portability--just toss it in a bag, tool box, or use the included sturdy pocket clip to keep it close at hand.

About Gerber: A History of Innovation
Savvy. Moxie. Craftsmanship. Attention to detail. These are just a few of the company traits that have contributed to Gerber's emergence as a world leader in outdoor gear. Joseph Gerber started Portland, Oregon's Gerber Advertising back in 1910, and one Christmas, he hired a local knife-maker to craft 25 sets of kitchen cutlery as client gifts. The knives were so popular Mr. Gerber ultimately left his agency to launch Gerber Legendary Blades in 1939.

It makes sense, really. An idea man gets the idea of a lifetime and turns it into a major outdoor brand--one that commands respect among knife lovers and knife makers alike. And now that same high regard is spreading in new directions, in the form of many outstanding products such as tools, personal L.E.D. lighting, and more.

About Recumbent Exercise Bikes
Despite the competition from trendy new fitness inventions, exercise bikes continue to be popular options for home exercise. They offer the same aerobic benefits of riding a bicycle at any time, in any weather, without leaving the comfort and safety of home. Exercise bikes don't take up much space, require little or no balance or coordination, and can provide an effective workout for all levels of users, from beginners to serious competitors. While the same could be said for a number of other types of home fitness equipment, the exercise bike is one of the few that allows you to watch television or read a magazine while you work out.

The term recumbent literally means ""lying down."" Exercising in a recumbent or reclining position allows the user to have full ergonomic back support, without causing strain on the arms, neck and shoulders, all of which can be common effects of using an upright bicycle. For many people, having convenient access to quality exercise equipment is critical to sticking with a long-term exercise program.

Compare These Treadmills

From beginners just starting an exercise regimen to advanced athletes looking to maintain their fitness level, anyone interested in getting and staying in shape can benefit greatly from regular use of a treadmill. Treadmills allow you to determine the pace, distance, and complexity of the workout based on your needs, all while watching television, talking on the telephone, or reading a magazine. Much easier on sensitive joints like the knees and hips, treadmill walking and running surfaces are typically long, padded platforms that allow ample room for a long stride and comfortable, low-impact walk or jog without the harsh contact of a concrete surface.

While many different types, styles, and price ranges of treadmills exist, many of them offer unique features like a fold-up design for easy storage, an electronic display monitor showing speed, distance, workout time, incline level, and burned calories, and EKG grip pulses to monitor the heart rate while exercising. Regardless of the simple to complex features you may choose, treadmills offer an array of aerobic exercise opportunities that will provide long-lasting beneficial cardiovascular results without a commute to the gym or a jog in the rain.

1599,"The Kinetic Road Machine Rear Wheel Trainer features a smooth quiet resistance from 5-3000 watts, and 6.25 lb. freewheel for realistic coast down. Features: Smooth quiet resistance from 5-3000 watts 6.25 lb. Freewheel for realistic coast down Sealed fluid chamber with magnetically-coupled driveshaft Guaranteed not to leak Unconditional Lifetime warranty on frame and resistance unit Compatible with all bikes with 16"" to 29"" diameter wheels Optional small wheel adapter required for 16"" to 22"" wheels



Perfect for sprints, intervals, and all-day cruising, the Kinetic Road Machine offers smooth, quiet resistance for indoor training. Like every Kinetic Trainer, the Road Machine operates with a 100% leak-proof, patented magnetic drive system. The power calibration gives you true outdoor simulation while the automatic resistance adjusts as you change speeds.



The Road Trainers 6.25-pound flywheel results in a smooth, road-like ride without altering the force curve. The flywheel delivers a realistic 15-second coast-down from 20 miles per hour.

With the trapezoidal leg design, the Road Trainer offers largest footprint of any trainer to keep power and motion focused on the flywheel. Even during hard, out-of-the-saddle pedaling, the ride remains rock steady.

Unlike other fluid trainers that lose resistance when the fluid is heated up, Kinetic Fluid Trainers use thermodynamically neutral liquid silicon to ensure a consistent, measurable and repeatable workload at all temperatures.

According to the laws of physics, energy is never lost or gained, but simply changes form. In the case of a fluid trainer, the energy of the spinning impeller inside the fluid chamber is converted into heat. Kinetic Fluid Trainers have been designed with 80 cast aluminum cooling fins to dissipate heat and provide the lowest operating temperature of any trainer.

The Road Trainer is fully compatible with wheels measuring from 22 to 29 inches (outside diameter), including bikes with flip-off skewers, breezer drops-outs, and nutted axles on track and BMX styling. A small wheel adapter is required for 16 to 21-inch wheels (sold separately).

Kinetic offers a 100 percent leakproof performance with a patented magnetic drive system that uses neodymium magnets to link the drive system together. This eliminates the problems caused when a physical drive shaft has to enter the fluid chamber--which means no need for O rings or seals that will eventually wear out and leak.

1602,"The Transfer's sculpted ventilation and hip styling are great for humans on the go. The clean lines and easy-to-use features are thoughtful touches that offer everything you need - and a little more than you expect.

The sleek, sculpted Giro Transfer bike helmet offers everything you need for commuting, touring, and cruising, and delivers a little more than you might expect. The Transfer is made using Giro's in-mold construction, which fuses a tough polycarbonate outer shell with the helmet's impact-absorbing EPA foam liner. Not only does this fusion process reinforce both layers, but the ""exoskeleton"" also allows Giro to engineer helmets that are lighter, more durable, and better ventilated. The helmet also employs Giro's patented Acu Dial fit system, which hugs the back of your head and reduces the tendency of your helmet to shift forwards or backwards. With a single-handed adjustment of the full-fit band, you can create a perfect fit regardless of your head shape or hair length (the helmet is even ponytail-compatible).

To keep you cool on the road, the Transfer comes with Giro's proprietary Wind Tunnel ventilation system, which combines 20 active vents with internal exhaust channels that thrust cool, fresh air over and around the rider's head while forcing heat and stale air out. The significant increase in air channeling makes a difference that riders will feel immediately.

The Transfer is a Universal Fit single-size helmet. Giro's Universal Fit family of helmets is sculpted to look good and fit great for most people on the first try. By developing unique shell sizes based on select customer groups and combining them with an adjustable-fit system, Universal Fit helmets make it easier for you to find the right fit, right out of the box, right away.

About Giro
Working late nights in his garage, designer/bike racer Jim Gentes created the first lightweight adult cycling helmet in 1985. Friends at NASA helped him tune the final helmet shape and vent placement, resulting in the Giro Prolight, a helmet that was better looking and better fitting than traditional designs yet still met the industry's toughest safety standards. Plus, it was half the weight of traditional helmets. Since then, Giro has advanced its helmets, many of which have set the standards for styling, function, and innovation for progressive, performance-oriented riders on dirt, pavement, and snow. Giro helmets are worn by millions of riders, cyclists, skiers, and snowboarders around the world: young bloods and old-timers; hardcores, heshers, and hipsters; rookies, experts, and a few regular Joes too--in fact, pretty much anyone that appreciates superior fit and function, cutting edge styling, and the very best ideas you get in a helmet. Giro is based in Scotts Valley, California.

The world standard for the sport of Ultimate, and official disc of the USA Ultimate Championship Series since 1991. With its contoured grip and aerodynamic engineering, the Ultra-Star has set the standard for quality, consistency, and performance.

Ultimate is a fast paced, non-contact field game that combines the non-stop movement and athletic endurance of soccer with the aerial passing skills of football.

A game is played by two seven-player squads on a field similar to football. The object of the game is to score by catching a pass in the opponent's end zone. The disc may be advanced only by completing a pass to a teammate. A team may throw as many passes as they wish and possession is retained as long as the disc is in the air — although the thrower has only 10 seconds to release a pass. All turnovers result in an immediate change of possession and a change of direction of play.

Games are generally played to 15 points. Each point begins with a 'pull' from end zone to end zone and teams switch ends after each score.

Helmet Tips--You Should Always..

About Giro
Working late nights in his garage, designer/bike racer Jim Gentes created the first lightweight adult cycling helmet in 1985. Friends at NASA helped tune the final helmet shape and vent placement, and the result was the Giro Prolight, a helmet that was better looking than traditional designs while offering a superior fit and still met the industry's toughest safety standards. Plus, it was half the weight of traditional helmets. Since then, Giro has advanced its helmets, many of which have set the standards for styling, function, and innovation for progressive, performance-oriented riders on dirt, pavement, and snow. Giro helmets are worn by millions of riders, cyclists, skiers, and snowboarders around the world. Young-bloods and old-timers; hard-cores, heshers, and hipsters; rookies, experts, and a few regular Joes too--in fact, pretty much anyone that appreciates superior fit and function, cutting edge styling, and the very best ideas you get in a helmet.

1694,"A big myth in the knife world is that out there somewhere is a knife that seriously cuts but cannot rust. Knives claiming these super powers are usually made with steels that are unable to hold a cutting edge for any measurable amount of time. Finally a steel foundry in Japan called Myodo Foundry makes this myth a reality with the introduction of a new steel called H1. H1 steel is a PH steel, meaning it is a precipitation-hardened steel. ""Huh"" you ask? Utilizing .1% nitrogen instead of carbon to harden the steel, it reaches a Rockwell hardness of 57-58rc. Spyderco uses H1 on its new C91 Pacific Salt model. It's PlainEdge or SpyderEdge and is similar in shape and size to Spyderco's best-selling Endura model but with a slightly more rounded tip. All internal steel parts are treated as well making them impervious to rust and pitting and of course, salt. Those challenged by cleaning and maintaining their knives will find the Pacific Salt stays rust-free even if put away wet. The blade's hole is enlarged to 14mm for easier opening/closing with gloved, wet or cold hands. Textured in a checkerboard pattern, the black FRN handle has a grippy texture and is fitted with a reversible titanium pocket clip which positions for right-handers and lefties. The addition of a lanyard hole offers a backup method of attachment (thong or lanyard cord) for use around water where once dropped, a knife is often lost or elusively hard to retrieve.

A commonly known rule of cutlery is that the less susceptible a blade is to rust, the less likely it is to be able to hold an edge over time. Thanks to a forward-thinking Japanese steel foundry, however, that's no longer the case. Myodo Foundry recently introduced a new steel called H1, a PH (precipitation-hardened) steel utilizing 0.1% nitrogen, rather than carbon, to harden the steel. This approach results in an impressive Rockwell hardness rating of 57-58rc, which is why innovative cutlery company Spyderco uses the steel in its Pacific Salt knife.

The knife is similar in size and shape to Spyderco's bestselling Endura knife, but with a slightly more rounded tip. All internal steel components are treated for rust and corrosion resistance, as well, and the blade hole is oversized for easy one-handed opening and closing, even with gloves or wet hands. Lightweight fiberglass reinforced nylon (FRN) material in the handle is inlayed with a grip-enhancing checkerboard pattern, and fitted with a reversible titanium pocket clip that can be positioned for right- or left-handed use.

About the manufacturer:
At Planet Bike we dream about bikes.  We dream about people riding bikes: riding to work, riding to school, riding bikes to the grocery store, concerts, sporting events, coffee shops and grandma's house, too.   We also dream about the day when all cities and towns are safe and convenient places for cyclists.
The reasons that we love riding and want others to share the love are as numerous as our pedal strokes. The sport of cycling thrills us; but, for us it's equally thrilling to unlock the potential of the bicycle as a simple and efficient means of transportation. Riding in place of driving reduces air and noise pollution. It boosts endorphins and clears the head. Riding strengthens the cardiovascular system, gives you good strong legs, and burns extra calories, to boot. Besides all that, it's a whole heck of a lot of fun.
Planet Bike was born from the heart of cyclists and our goal is to create innovative products that make it easier and safer for people to ride bicycles.  The products we design are rooted in this dream.  Riding through day, night, heat, cold, rain and snow helps us come up with products that make sense, work, and are practical.

About Planet Bike
In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment.

Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact.

Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

Chop firewood quickly and efficiently, or saw limbs to improve shooting lanes.

About Gerber: A History of Innovation
Savvy. Moxie. Craftsmanship. Attention to detail. These are just a few of the company traits that have contributed to Gerber's emergence as a world leader in outdoor gear. Joseph Gerber started Portland, Oregon's Gerber Advertising back in 1910, and one Christmas, he hired a local knife-maker to craft 25 sets of kitchen cutlery as client gifts. The knives were so popular Mr. Gerber ultimately left his agency to launch Gerber Legendary Blades in 1939.

It makes sense, really. An idea man gets the idea of a lifetime and turns it into a major outdoor brand--one that commands respect among knife lovers and knife makers alike. And now that same high regard is spreading in new directions, in the form of many outstanding products such as tools, personal L.E.D. lighting, and more.

What's in the Box
Gerber 22-41420 Gator Axe II with internal saw and nylon sheath.





The short-handled Gator was such a hit when it debuted, we decided to offer a version with a longer handle. Dubbed the Gator II, this all-conditions axe makes a great addition to your basic camping gear. The longer handle results in greater striking force. And that force is kept safely under control because of our Gator texturing, which maximizes your grip. The rigid part of the handle is glass-filled nylon that's extremely rugged yet lightweight. A saw can insert inside the handle and be held in place by an internal magnet. The axe head is an all-business rendering of forged steel, noted for edge retention.

1767,"The Legendary Self-Cleaning Lubricant. You've known and loved White Lightning for its ""Original Self-Cleaning Lube"" - but boy, what a long name… and we know we all use it because it stays clean - so we've renamed it, but no worries, no changes have been made to the formula - it's the same lube but now with a new name that says it all, in just two words; Clean Ride.! Clean Ride is Cycling's Only Self-Cleaning Lubricant. Clean Ride literally sheds dirt & grime while you ride, keeping your bike running smoothly. Clean Ride sets up as a dry wax film. There is no oily film to attract abrasive contaminants, so your chain and gears will perform better and last 2 to 3 times longer. Clean Ride's self-cleaning action is activated by any dirt, grit or grime that finds it's way onto your chain or parts. Small particles of the outer wax structure will flake off, taking the dirt, grime or grit with it. This begins the cycle of 'self-cleaning'. Clean Ride is a unique, wax-based lubricant, so it is important to start with a clean chain. For optimum 'self-cleaning' performance, do not mix Clean Ride with oil based lubricants. The dirtier the ride, the more active the shedding action. So to this extent, Clean Ride will require more frequent re-application after dirtier rides. When Clean Ride is used regularly and properly, you'll rarely have to clean your chain again. So, while your buddies are cleaning their chains, you'll be applying a fresh shot of Clean Ride and heading out for yet another great ride!

White Lightning's Clean Ride product is a self-cleaning, wax-based lubricant for bicycle chains, derailleurs, and cables. It sets up as a dry wax finish, shedding dirt and grime while you ride and helping to keep your bike running smoothly. Small particles of the outer wax structure will flake off, taking the dirt, grime or grit with it, which begins the cycle of ""self-cleaning."" There is no oily film to attract abrasive contaminants, so your chain and gears will perform better and last up to three times longer.

Clean Ride is a unique, wax-based lubricant, so it is important to start with a clean chain. For optimum ""self-cleaning"" performance, do not mix Clean Ride with oil based lubricants, and note that the dirtier your most recent ride, the more active the shedding action. To this extent, Clean Ride will require more frequent re-application after dirtier rides and, when used regularly and properly, you'll rarely have to clean your chain again. (U.S. patents 5,472,625; 5,670,463; 5,885,947; and 5898022.)

About White Lightning
In 1994, retired research chemist Paul Maples was determined to find a way to end the messy inconvenience and performance inefficiencies caused by the dirt, grease, and grime build up on his bike chain. He set out to develop the first and only chain lube that would ""self-clean,"" which he dubbed Clean Ride. The product actually repels and sheds dirt and grime from your chain and parts while you ride, and was so unique it was awarded four U.S. patents. In 2000, Paul sold White Lightning to Hank Krause, who had been developing performance bicycle lubricants since the mid 1980s. Krausse and his team took over, and -- with continued collaboration from Maples -- the result has been a steadily growing line of bike maintenance products.

Made from the bark of long-lived cork oak trees, cork is stripped from the trees every decade, a process that actually maintains the health of the trees and their surrounding ecosystem. Cork is extremely durable yet slightly porous, giving it the perfect balance for use in yoga blocks. Plus, cork's natural texture provides traction, while the rounded edges create a comfortable surface for supported poses. And because cork is a completely natural fiber, there's no off-gassing as there would be with chemically treated products. A favorite of eco-minded consumers, the Hugger Mugger block measures 9 by 5.5 by 3.5 inches (W x H x D).

The Thule Parkway 4-Bike Hitch carrier is an easy-to-use entry-level bike carrier that safely and conveniently transports up to four bikes. Hooking right into your vehicle's existing hitch receiver (model 957 - only 1¼ inch / model 956 - only 1¼ inch), it makes getting your bicycles to and from the trailhead or other ride start points simple and worry-free. The Thule Parkway 4-Bike Hitch carrier features rubberized cradles, which secure and protect your bike frames while holding them firmly and thanks to the dual arm design. There is no need for the top-tube adapters sometimes required for certain bikes - this carrier holds 'em all. Additional features include: the ability to tilt the carrier away from vehicle for trunk, hatch or tailgate access; durable construction; and compatibility with certain locking systems (sold separately).

Designed for durable entry-level use, the Parkway 4-Bike Hitch Carrier accommodates up to four bikes utilizing an existing hitch receiver at the tail end of your vehicle. (Thule model number 956 accommodates 2 inch receivers only, while model number 957 is designed for 1¼ receivers only) Both variations of the Parkway 4-Bike carrier are incredibly strong, stable and full featured, with durable high-strength steel construction and varied standard components, including: rubberized carrier arm cradles that prevent bike-to-bike and bike-to-vehicle contact which dramatically reduces the chance of scratches to vehicles and bikes; and compatibility with certain locking systems (sold separately). These locking systems include: the Snug-Tite receiver lock, which virtually eliminates hitch rack movement in receiver and locks the hitch rack to the vehicle and Thule's 6 ft. Braided Steel Cable # 538, which locks bikes to the carrier.

In addition, when not loaded with bikes the Parkway 4-Bike Hitch Carrier has the convenient ability to tilt the carrier's upright structure away from the vehicle that it is mounted on. Users simply need to remove the tethered safety pin and gently lower the entire upright assembly of the carrier to a built-in stopping position in the form of an angled contour at the outward end of the stinger component. This easy functionality allows for hatch or tailgate access (bikes must be removed first) and means that you can get to every corner of your vehicle when you want to, without having to remove the carrier. Also impressive is the Parkway's quick installation procedures. With significantly few parts to assemble than other carriers in its class and requiring only user-supplied socket and adjustable wrenches, the Parkway can be installed in no time by just about anyone, and removed just as easily.

About Coleman
More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.

In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

1947,"The 110 Folding Hunter is a traditional favorite! Buck's Folding Hunter was created in 1963 when Al Buck decided that a revolutionary lockblade knife was needed by outdoorsmen who wanted a sturdy knife but did not want to carry a long fixed-blade knife. He was right and the result proved to be the key to the company's future. The challenge was to combine the strengths of other folding knives with locking mechanisms into a good-looking, reliable product. It wasn't easy, but after a series of refinements, the Model 110 was unveiled. Within six months, this innovation was the hottest knife in the industry. The Folding Hunter, after over 50 years, is still one of America's best-selling knives.

The 110 Folding Hunter--Buck's signature knife--originally debuted in 1962, making it a good year for knife safety. The Folding Hunter is equipped with a nail-notch lockback design that opens easily and closes safely during any activity, ensuring that the knife never goes out of style. The knife's 3-3/4-inch stainless-steel clip blade, meanwhile, is ideal for detail work, such as piercing and cutting in tight places. And users will love the natural wood-grain handles and polished brass bolsters, which add a classic touch to the design.

The generously-sized 45 mm steel case showcases a bright orange dial with bold luminous hands and markers, a luminous seconds hand, and a large day/date window at the three o'clock hour. A highly scratch-resistant curved Hardlex crystal magnifies the dial, optimizing its readability. The dial is framed by a unidirectional rotating steel bezel with engraved dive time markers for safe timing of dives and other limited events. The 21-jewel Japan automatic movement means this watch winds itself with the natural motion of your wrist and never requires a battery.

About Seiko
In 1877, at the age of 18, Kintaro Hattori set up business repairing the Western-style clocks that were becoming increasingly popular in Japan. By 1892, Hattori was manufacturing his own clocks in a factory he called Seikosha, from the words ""seiko"" meaning ""exquisite,"" ""success,"" or ""miniature,"" and ""sha"" meaning ""house."" The company grew and prospered, producing its first wristwatch in 1913 and launching the Seiko brand in 1924. Technological innovation has always been a driving force in the company's history. Key milestones include Seiko's introduction of the world's first quartz watch in 1969, and its successful launch, in 1988, of the Kinetic, the world's first battery-free watch with quartz accuracy. Recognized for its technological excellence, Seiko has provided timekeeping services for the Olympic Games and the World Cup Soccer Championships. Today, the Seiko brand continues to stand for state-of-the-art technology, as well as superior quality and refined design.

1965,"Bold styling combines with a classic design in this automatic watch #8928 from Invicta's Pro Diver collection. This sporty yet refined timepiece features a two-tone gold-plated and silver-tone stainless steel case, bezel, and bracelet strap. Protected by an anti-reflective mineral crystal with magnifier, a vivid blue dial showcases easy-to-read hands and markers, as well as a date display at three o'clock. Automatic 21-jewel movement is both shock resistant and reliable, while water resistance to 200 meters (660 feet) helps guard against the elements.

Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

The rack's patented tie-down system, meanwhile, individually secures and protects up to three bikes at once. As easy to install as it is to use, the rack sets up in seconds.

About Allen Bike Racks In 1967, after a few years of working on the aerospace technology for the Apollo missions, Dick Allen was out of a job. Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his family's bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities.

Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks shortly afterward. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dick's son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage-run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and sells products in more than a dozen countries around the world.

Fitting a Helmet
Here are some guidelines to getting the best fit for a bike helmet.

About Giro
Working late nights in his garage, designer/bike racer Jim Gentes created the first lightweight adult cycling helmet in 1985. Friends at NASA helped tune the final helmet shape and vent placement, and the result was the Giro Prolight, a helmet that was better looking than traditional designs while offering a superior fit and still met the industry's toughest safety standards. Plus, it was half the weight of traditional helmets. Since then, Giro has advanced its helmets, many of which have set the standards for styling, function, and innovation for progressive, performance-oriented riders on dirt, pavement, and snow. Giro helmets are worn by millions of riders, cyclists, skiers, and snowboarders around the world. Young-bloods and old-timers; hard-cores, heshers, and hipsters; rookies, experts, and a few regular Joes too--in fact, pretty much anyone that appreciates superior fit and function, cutting edge styling, and the very best ideas you get in a helmet.

This is an automatic mechanical watch. Automatic watches do not operate on batteries; instead, they are powered automatically by the movement of the wearer’s arm. If the main spring in your automatic watch is not wound sufficiently, timekeeping may become less accurate. In order to maintain accuracy, wear the watch for 8 hours or more per day, or manually wind the main spring by turning the crown. When not in use, automatic watches may be kept charged with an automatic watch winder – a watch storage unit which may be purchased separately.

About Eureka
Though the exact year is unknown, Eurekas long history begins prior to 1895 in Binghamton, New York, where the company still resides today. Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents.

The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM ""tent cities"" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased.

In 1960, Eurekas new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20°F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition.

For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary.

Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Womens Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian.

Amazon.com Tent Guide
Selecting a Tent
Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Expect the Worst
In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.

Three- and Four-Season Tents
For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.

For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.

Domes and Tunnels
Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.

Size Matters
Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.

Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20°F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition.

For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary.

Selecting a Tent
Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Expect the Worst
In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.

Three- and Four-Season Tents
For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.

For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.

Domes and Tunnels
Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.

Size Matters
Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.

Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

About Eureka
Though the exact year is unknown, Eurekas long history begins prior to 1895 in Binghamton, New York, where the company still resides today. Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents.

The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM ""tent cities"" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the companys annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased.

Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.

Size Matters
Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.

Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

Selecting a Tent
Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Expect the Worst
In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.

Three- and Four-Season Tents
For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.

For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.

Domes and Tunnels
Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect.

Sleep Well: Finding the Right Sleeping Bag
Sleeping bag technology has come a long way from the days of cowboy bedrolls. These days, there are a number of high-tech materials and designs available to keep you warm during the coldest outings. Here's a short list of things to keep in mind when you're shopping for a bag:

Buy for Cold
It's a safe bet that on at least one of your adventures, the nighttime temperature will drop unexpectedly. That's why it's smart to buy a bag that's rated for the lowest possible temperature you expect to face on your camping and backpacking trips. For summer trips, a bag rated at +35 degrees or higher will likely do the trick. If you like to camp in higher elevations in the summer, or if spring and fall outings are in your future, consider bags rated from +10 to +35. Winter adventurers should look for bags in the -10 to +10 range, while those on serious winter alpine climbs and expeditions will want a bag rated lower than -10.

Keep in mind that sleeping bag manufacturers' temperature ratings only estimate the minimum temperature at which the bag will provide warmth. Take these numbers with a grain of salt, as different folks generate different amounts of heat when they sleep. If you're the type who likes to pile on the covers even on warmer nights, go for a bag that's rated ten degrees colder. The opposite is true for ""warm"" sleepers--a 35-degree bag will probably work for you on a 25-degree night.

Goose or No Goose?
The most important component of any sleeping bag is its insulating material. Modern sleeping bags offer two choices: goose down or synthetic. While both materials have advantages and disadvantages, down bags are considered superior because of their phenomenal warmth-to-weight and warmth-to-bulk ratios. While providing great insulation, down is extremely compressible and light. There's a reason why geese can fly and stay warm through the winter! Down also boasts great long-term durability and will typically retain its insulating properties after years of use.

All of that said, there are many high-quality synthetic bags on the market and synthetic materials are getting better all the time. While a synthetic bag will weigh somewhat more than a down bag at an equivalent temperature rating, synthetic bags perform better when wet. (Yes, the Achilles heel of down is that it loses all insulating properties when wet.) If your trips take you to wet climates, you may want to consider a synthetic bag for this reason alone. Keep in mind, too, that many people are allergic to down--synthetic bags are non-allergenic. Finally, down is considerably more expensive than synthetic, which might tip the balance for adventurers on a budget.

Bags for All Shapes
Sleeping bags come in two basic shapes that reflect their intended use. Mummy-shaped bags offer the best warmth because they conform to the body's contours. This minimizes the amount of body heat the body must put out to maintain a constant temperature. Many mummy bags are offered in women-specific shapes and sizes, as well. Rectangular bags, while they do offer more room to toss and turn, are less thermally efficient because they contain more open air space. Also, they are typically heavier than mummy bags, and are generally not offered with down insulation, making them best suited for car camping or short backpacking trips.

Pad Yourself
No matter what kind of bag you choose, a sleeping pad is a required accessory. Not only do they provide much-needed comfort when sleeping on the ground, pads also offer crucial warmth for your backside, as the weight of your body compresses--and renders virtually useless--the sleeping bag insulation that lies beneath you.

Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian.

Strengthen your core with the simple, effective, and economical Double Ab Wheel by Ironman. This straightforward, inexpensive, and low-bulk piece of exercise equipment tones and builds strength in your core abdominal and back muscles, as well as your arm and shoulder muscles in one simple exercise. Composed of a sturdy metal post, two rolling wheels for stability, and rubber grips for comfort, the Ab Wheel is easy to disassemble and toss in a suitcase. Unlike bulky ab balls or chairs, the Ab Wheel can be stowed just about anywhere. Its rubber contoured handles provide a comfortable and secure grip and its double wheel provides stability. Extremely durable and smooth rolling, the Ab Wheel strengthens your abdominals from top to bottom as well as your back, arms, and shoulders through one fluid movement.

To use the Ab Wheel, you start out on your knees with one hand on each grip. You then slowly roll the wheel out and away from your knees and continue going forward until your hands are beyond your head without touching the floor. You return to your starting position by pulling in with your abdominal muscles and arching your back. Unlike sit-ups and other targeted abdominal exercises, the Ab Wheel challenges more muscles groups in less time. Users of the Ab Wheel feel the exercise in their chest, upper and lower back, triceps, and biceps as well, improving their allover body strength and alignment, and find that they can achieve exciting results with fewer repetitions than with sit-ups and crunches.

2042,"Continental 0118356 Grand Prix 4000-700 x 20 Black Tire with Black Chili is one of the few tires that miraculously delivers on all fronts. It is light, offers tremendous puncture protection with Vectran, and provides amazing handling and low rolling resistance thanks to Black Chili. The patented Vectran Breaker reconciles the conflicting goals of low weight, low rolling resistance and top puncture and cut resistance in a fascinating manner. The material is extremely tear and cut resistant and is also flexible. It retains these properties even under constant stress. The new Black Chili material incorporates rubber compound particles roughly ten times smaller than what is typically used in bicycle tires. This creates a denser rubber, without adding more material. Denser rubber increases a tires ability to conform to the road, while also increasing durability. The Black Chili compound is also more resistant to UV rays, which contribute to cracking and premature tire wear. The Grand Prix tires also come equipped with tire wear indicators so the rider knows when to swap out tires. Specs: Color - black/black skin foldable; Black Chili - yes; Weight - 180 grams; Recommended PSI - 130; Maximum PSI - 160; PU - 10.

2062,"ATTRIBUTES Band: Polyurethane Dive Strap Bezel: Aluminum Case: Fiberglass Dial: Black w/Date Movement: Swiss Size: 43mm Submersible: 200M

Prized for its durability and unique illumination system, the Luminox Original Navy SEAL Series 1 stainless steel men's watch exudes confidence and power whenever it's worn. Thanks to the vaunted Luminox self-powered illumination system, this watch's hands and dial markers glow 100 times brighter than other luminous watches and will provide continuous illumination for more than 25 years. It's also water resistant to 200 meters (20 ATM, 660 feet), which is suitable for recreational scuba diving.

The large, black-plated stainless steel watch case--measuring 1.7 inches wide and 0.4 inches thick--is topped by a ratcheting, unidirectional rotating bezel with engraved 5-minute Arabic numerals in white and coin-edged detailing for an improved grip. The black dial face is accented by white Arabic numeral markers, large white baton hands (with seconds hand), and a date function at 3 o'clock. It's completed by a comfortable polyurethane (PU) diver's strap in black. Other features include a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal with anti-reflective coating, multi-jeweled Swiss quartz watch movement, double gasket crown, and 4-year battery life. It's backed by a 1-year Luminox warranty.

Luminox Self-Powered Illumination System
Each Luminox watch employs tiny self-powered micro gas lights (borosilicate glass capsules), which are firmly embedded in the hands and the hour indicators on the watch face (as well as on the turning ring of diver's watches). Luminox watches need no external light source to ""charge"" the paint on the dial or hands in order to glow as do conventional luminous watches, nor do they require a push of a button to light the dial as do electro luminescent watches.

About Luminox
Luminox combines the finest tradition and precision of Swiss watchmaking with the durability demanded by US armed forces and the latest innovations in timepiece technology. The company pioneered the development of small, individual luminescent tracer lamps and was contacted by the U.S. Navy SEAL teams to build a dive watch for their use on night missions. After their popularity in the Navy grew, the Air Force asked Luminox to develop a watch specifically for F-117 Nighthawk Stealth pilots.

2064,"AN AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY

Like many other American success stories, LUMINOX came from a forward-thinking individual realizing a need in the market and meeting it. Barry Cohen had been in the fashion watch business for quite some time when he came across a Swiss self-powered illumination system and knew that it would make watches more visible and easier to read in low or no light situations. As a result, Cohen and a partner developed watches using this unique illumination system (called Luminox Light Technology) and LUMINOX was born back in 1989 (Lumi is Latin for light while Nox is Latin for night), driven by a commitment to offer cutting-edge luminescence and readability in its line of high-performance sports watches.

The Navy SEALs and More
The Luminox Navy SEAL watch is the timepiece that made Luminox famous. The officer in charge of procurement for the Navy SEALs, Nick North, was asked to seek a more dependable watch for night missions and found the solution at a trade show where he discovered Luminox. He worked with Barry Cohen to develop a watch specifically for them and the Navy SEAL watch was born.

""Luminox had exactly the watch we were looking for  we only added a few small things,"" Nick North, Senior Public Safety Engineer and Operations Specialist, remembered. ""We arranged to test some and they worked great. We made a few changes, then the East Coast team started issuing them and the West Coast teams came on board.""

After Luminox provided the watches to the SEALs, more elite units contacted them directly, while at the same time Luminox began marketing the watch across the country and the world. Luminox was then approached by US Air Force pilots flying the F-117 Nighthawk Stealth fighter jet. They were wearing the Navy SEAL timepieces, but chafed at the word ""Navy"" on the dial. Luminox then developed a watch for these pilots and approached Lockheed Martin, the makers of the F-117 Nighthawk for a picture of the plane to use in the catalogs that marketed the watches.

This initial contact turned into an exclusive arrangement to produce Lockheed Martin timepieces, including watches dedicated to the F-117 Nighthawk, F-16 Fighting Falcon, SR-111 Blackbird and the new F-22 Raptor.

The Rest of the Story
Throughout the following 20 years, Luminox has never strayed from its mission which has been confirmed and validated by the many elite military and law enforcement units that have adopted Luminox as standard equipment.

Luminox has expanded its collection to include a variety of styles, created for the active consumer, the sportsman, law enforcement and military groups, divers and more. Currently, Luminox is distributed in 40 countries around the world and supplies elite units all over the world. In addition, the man on the street has shown particular interest in Luminox, anxious to use the watches put to the test every single day  on the worlds most difficult jobs, figuring rightly that if they have been requested by, designed for and used by the Navy SEALs, they have to be able to stand up to every day use.

The Technology
The Luminox Light Technology makes Luminox watches Always Visible  in fact, the technology Luminox uses provides 24/7 luminosity, no matter the conditions, for more than 25 years.

Most other watches use luminescent paint that has to be charged by a light source and fades very quickly, or a ""push to light"" system, where you push a button for battery-driven illumination.

Luminox, however, uses proprietary technology, in the past reserved for the military, that makes Luminox watches stand out, literally. Each Luminox watch features tiny gas lights (borosilicate glass capsules), which are always lit, on the hands, hour markers and when necessary, bezels. As a result of this unique technology, Luminox watches are always readable at a glance, no matter the conditions.

The U.S. military has long recognized the advantages of micro gas light sources and their use is mandated in procurement specification MIL-W-46374F. Being able to read the watches in any conditions, even in total darkness, is an important requirement of many military and law enforcement agencies.

The U.S. Navy SEALs use the watches, as do U.S. Air Force pilots, FBI and ATF agents, Secret Service officers, Border Patrol units, Coast Guard officers, SWAT teams, as well as general law enforcement officers, helicopter search and rescue pilots, professional divers and other groups.

The Luminox Light Technology system is hand applied in each and every watch. Though more complicated, expensive and time consuming than normal luminescence, it is one of the things that makes Luminox watches special. This unique technology and the additional quality control steps Luminox mandates require extraordinary attention to detail and care in manufacturing.

The Benefits

Production
All Luminox watches are Swiss Made, produced by Luminoxs corporate partner, Mondaine Watch Company, one of the leaders in Swiss manufacturing. Located in Zurich with manufacturing facilities in Biberist, Switzerland, Mondaine recently won a Swiss Logistics Award for its ""just in time"" production. Mondaine applies its more than 50 years of experience when producing the complicated Luminox watches.

The Future
Luminox will continue to combine cutting edge technology, forward-thinking design and extreme performance. Luminox delivers, when and where it counts.

Sleek, attractive, and easy to operate, the E37S-K showcases SOG's sophisticated style and quality construction. Designed for use by Navy SEALs, the E37S-K features a thick steel stock (.185 inches), an AUS8 stainless steel heat-treated blade, a long ergonomic handle, deep finger grooves, and more.



Cryogenic Heat Treatment and TiNi Coating Guarantee a Sharp, Durable Blade
The E37S-K offers a full, 4.85-inch, AUS8 stainless steel blade that has undergone SOG's patented Cryogenic Heat Treatment process, which ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly reducing the blade's temperature to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then slowly heating the blade to room temperature. The stress created by this process strengthens the steel on an atomic level and increases the blade's overall durability and edge retention.

In addition to having undergone the Cryogenic Heat Treatment Process, this knife is coated in proprietary titanium nitride (TiNi), of the toughest coatings that can be applied to steel. TiNi boasts extreme hardness, is exceptionally scratch and peel resistant, and helps increase steel's longevity.

Ergonomic, Lightweight Design Ensures Years of Effortless Use
Even if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make precise cuts if your knife doesn't fit comfortably in your hand. That's why this knife's handle is ergonomically contoured. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the textured handle is also slip-free and well-balanced. Other ergonomic features include deep finger grooves and a blade spine rasp for easy notching, filing, and thumb placement. Also, at just 5.4 ounces, this knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A tactical Kydex sheath is included for convenient portability.

This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.

About Easton
In 1922, Doug Easton began crafting custom wood bows and cedar arrows in Watsonville, California. Although Doug produced tournament-grade, footed cedar arrows for the archery champions of that era, he was constantly frustrated with the inconsistency and lack of uniformity of wood shafts. Convinced that consistently straight uniform arrow shafts were impossible to manufacture from wood, Doug turned his attentions to aluminum. In 1939, he began manufacturing aluminum arrows in Los Angeles. His instincts about this material were correct, and in 1941, California archer Larry Hughes won the national championship with a set of Doug's aluminum arrows. This was the beginning of a trend that would change traditional archery and transcend into numerous other sports arenas over the next 50 years. Considered one of the world's preeminent innovators, designers, and manufacturers of sporting equipment, Easton has a reputation of producing products for the highest level of performance.

Bushnell has engineered the Nightwatch with Built-In Infrared Monocular to produce images with resolution that rivals costly Generation 2 and 3 optics. Using a powerful infrared spotlight that produces sharp images even in pitch darkness, the Stealthview monocular is ideal for a wide variety of applications including security and surveillance, camping, night fishing, navigation, and wildlife observation. This powerful infrared technology works by providing a light source for the Nightwatch system to amplify and collect through an objective lens. This collected light is then processed through an image sensor to produce a high-quality image that is magnified at 2x or 4x (depending on model). Designed for use in a variety of terrains, the lightweight Nightwatch monocular features a built-in tripod mount and rugged rubber armor around an ergonomically shaped body for added comfort during prolonged use. The Nightwatch monocular operates on two AA batteries and provides a long viewing range, making it the perfect nightvision monocular for nighttime adventures.

2084,"Use of a snap cap prevents firing pin breakage often caused by ""dry firing"" during practice or when wanting to remove spring tension from the firing pin or hammer. Don't think a fired cartridge can do the same because once the primer is indented, there is no more cushioning effect. In these well made snap caps, when the solid brass ""primer"" is hit, it moves forward against spring pressure to cushion the firing pin so it does not slam against steel. With today's high gunsmithing prices, a broken firing pin can be very expensive. Protect yours with a quality snap cap. These are not made in some Third World country either, but are first rate European quality.

Each pedal is designed for easy clip-in and extra stability, with a spring-loaded platform that automatically position the pedal at the perfect angle for clipping in. All the rider has to do is put a foot on the pedal and push down. The intuitive operation makes this pedal particularly well suited to city riders that need to clip in and out at a moment's notice, along with aggressive mountain bike riders tackling technical terrain. The platform also offers greater stability than other pedals, and can be ridden without special shoes for impromptu jaunts to the grocery store.

About Shimano
In 1961, a three-speed bicycle hub was displayed at the New York Toy Show. The hub--an affordable and reliable version of the multi-speed hubs growing in popularity at the time--caught the attention of the industry. So much so that by 1965, Yoshizo Shimano--the youngest son of the company founder in Japan--opened an office in New York. Shimano's goal was to get quicker product feedback and to provide technical and warranty assistance to retailers selling bikes equipped with Shimano parts. Though Shimano American has grown from that first modest office staffed by only three people to a full distribution center with sales and marketing offices, its goals are the same: listen to customers and meet their needs for both bicycle and fishing products.

Outdoor enthusiasts looking for the next great gear idea, they went on to design the world's first self-inflating mattress, the Therm-A-Rest. Today, Cascade Designs remains a private, family-owned company that has grown to be one of the most respected outdoor manufacturers in the world.

The compact, highly accurate instrument is made of durable, clear, scratch-resistant acrylic that's been ergonomically designed to fit in the palm of your hand. More significantly, the compass employs Suunto's two-zone system to achieve precise, accurate readings regardless of where you're traveling.

However, as people began to travel more, it became clear that globe-hopping adventurers needed compasses with a greater geographical range. Suunto's two-zone system, by contrast, considers only the northern and southern hemispheres. In practice, this means that a Suunto compass designed for the northern hemisphere--as the A-10 is--will still work for a fair distance into the southern hemisphere and vice-versa. Suunto is one of only two compass manufacturers to offer two-zone compasses.

2205,"We feel most alive when we’re furthest from life’s routine. The air seems fresher when we ski unmarked slopes, define our own trail, or escape to our secluded fishing spot. Creating a relationship with nature nourishes like no technology can. Timex® Expedition® watches reflect the secluded terrain that inspires adventure, and are built to endure the depths and elements you subject yourself to.

While it looks like a casual watch, the Timex Men's T45171 Expedition Analog-Digital Chrono Alarm Timer Black Fast Wrap Velcro Strap Watch adds a stylish yet rugged complement to your everyday wear. It features a large black resin watch case that's topped by a silver-tone bi-directional rotating bezel with black elapsed time markings. The black dial includes large stick markers, arrow-tipped luminous hands (with red seconds hand), and small minute indexes. It also features a digital window at the bottom of the dial, which offers the ability to track three time zones, a 24-hour chronograph (with lap/split option), 24-hour countdown timer, and an alarm. Other features include a comfortable black nylon Fast Wrap strap (with buckle clasp) and water resistance to 100 meters (330 feet).

The Indiglo® night-light uniformly lights the surface of the watch dial using patented blue electroluminescent lighting technology. It uses less battery power than most other watch illumination systems, enabling your watch battery to last longer. The Night Mode feature allows you to illuminate the Indiglo® night-light for 3 seconds with any button press, regardless of the mode or function.



With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.

Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

Built to withstand the toughest hunting conditions, these scopes integrate shock-, fog-, and water-proof construction, as well as numerous other features rarely found on riflescopes in this price range. Nikon's Brightvue anti-reflective system of multicoated lenses provides over 92% anti-reflection capability for the high levels of light transmission and optical clarity necessary for dawn-to-dusk big game hunting. After the lenses are cut and polished, Nikon coats them with multiple layers of anti-reflective compounds. The compounds serve to boost light transmission, improve contrast to pull game out of its surroundings, deliver true color rendition and flare-free viewing, and enhance the overall image quality.

The brightest in its class, the Nikon Buckmasters riflescope has a proven track record of reliability, durability, and precision, making it a true hunter's workhorse. The scope is at home on nearly any hunting rifle, muzzle loader, or even rimfire, boasting a rugged, one-inch main body tube, a bullet drop compensating (BDC) reticle for easy holdover out to 600 yards (magnum calibers), and ultra-high-performance lenses.

The BDC reticle is perhaps the most compelling feature, as its trajectory-compensating system is designed and calibrated to provide fast, simple aiming points for various shot distances. The unique system integrates a series of small ""ballistic circles"" to produce an unobstructed view of the target.

Keep yourself hydrated with the reusable Klean Kanteen stainless steel water bottle, which now comes in a variety of colors. Klean Kanteens are made from #304 stainless steel, the material of choice in the food processing, dairy, and brewery industries. Stainless steel is easy to clean, durable, inert, sanitary, toxin-free, and non-leaching. It's also toxin- and BPA-free and 100 percent recyclable in most areas.

Klean Kanteen bottles do not have a chemical lining like some other metal bottles, and they won't ever leach a chemical taste into your drinks. The large-mouth design makes it easy to pour in ice cubes or a smoothie packed with frozen strawberries. It's also easy to clean--just scrub it out with white vinegar and baking soda (or mild soap and water), or load it in the dishwasher. It's topped by a polypropylene looped cap that makes it easy to grab on the go. All Klean Kanteens are backed by a 1-year manufacturer's warranty.

Klean Kanteen bottles come in several sizes:



18 Ounces
Grown-ups love the 18 ounce bottle for its compact, easy-to-carry, lightweight size that slips into bags, cup-holders, and even the water bottle cage on your bike.

27 Ounces
Klean Kanteen's most popular size, 27 ounces is a perfect amount for juggling a full day of classes or work, kids' extracurricular schedules, a trip to the dog park, and more.

40 Ounces
When 27 ounces isn't enough, you may need 40. The mother of all water bottles, the 40-ounce Klean Kanteen is great for long car trips, camping, a late-night session at the office, trips to the beach, or any time you need to carry a lot of liquid and don't have the option of easy refills.



Can I put hot liquids in my Klean Kanteen?
No. Klean Kanteen bottles are single walled and not for use with hot liquids. Warm beverages can be used at personal comfort level. The single-walled construction allows for more volume and the option to put your Kanteen on a flame.

Can I put my Kanteen in the freezer?
We do not recommend it and it will void the one-year warranty against manufacturer defects.

Can I put my Kanteen on a stove?
In a pinch, the Kanteen can be placed on fire or a stove. Beware not to melt the plastic lid or burn yourself.

What is stainless steel?
Stainless steel is an iron-containing alloy made from some of the basic elements found on earth: iron ore, chromium, silicon, nickel, carbon, nitrogen, and manganese. Properties of the final alloy are tailored by varying amounts of these elements. There are more than 57 stainless steels recognized as standard alloys on the market. Klean Kanteens are constructed from high-quality, sanitary-grade 304 stainless steel which has a low nickel content. Stainless steel has excellent resistance to stain or rust due to its chromium content. Stainless steel is easy to clean, durable, inert and sanitary.

History and Heritage
In 1884, Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland. There, he and the cutlers’ union he formed produced the finest steel cutlery, finished with the now-famous proprietary edge preferred globally by professional and home cooks. In 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife and in 1897 with the Officer’s Knife. In 1921, after the death of his mother, Victoria, and with the advent of stainless steel, then known as “inoxydable"""""""""""""""" and used in the production of his cutlery, Karl changed the name of the company to Victorinox. It is from those humble beginnings that a worldwide icon was born.

Today, Victorinox is still owned and operated by the Elsener family, and both the company and family still resides in the small village of Ibach, Switzerland.

Care Tips for Swiss Army Knives
The various tools are manufactured from high-quality steel with precisely tuned features that are essential for the particular application. The steel is tempered, annealed and polished to achieve the necessary hardness and provide optimum resistance to corrosion.

Sharpening
To re-sharpen your knife, use a whetstone at an angle of 15°– 20°. This will result in a cutting angle of 30°– 40°. If sharpening on a grinding wheel, always cool with plenty of water to avoid excessive temperatures and the resulting damages that may occur.

Cleaning
After you’ve used your Swiss Army Knife for all of its various applications, such as cutting open numerous boxes, you may notice that the blades begin to stick together. Opening and closing the blades in warm water several times will allow the tools to easily move again. Once they have dried, it is recommended, to apply a small drop of oil between the blade or tool shank and the spring. To optimally maintain the locking mechanism, periodically apply a drop of our recommended Swiss Army Knife Oil. Never put Swiss Army Knives in the dishwasher.

About Victorinox
In 1884, Swiss cutler Karl Elsener set up shop in Ibach-Schwyz, installing a waterwheel in Tobelbach Brook to run his grinding and polishing machines. Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.

The digital compass displays 16 directions and has a 5-set memory capacity that captures direction, month, date, and measurements time data. The altimeter measures up to 32,800 feet (10,000 meters) in 20-foot (5-meter) increments, and it can store 50 sets of altitude memory with date and temperature. It also provides a target altitude alarm and graphing capability for target and altitude tendency.

This large, round watch features a gray/green resin case that's topped by a black bidirectional bezel with compass markings. It offers a 1/100-second stopwatch with a 60-minute measuring capacity and elapsed time, split time, and 1st/2nd place time modes. It also includes a daily alarm, optional hourly time signal, and 12/24-hour formats. Other features include a comfortable resin strap, scratch-resistant mineral crystal, and AfterGlow LED electro-luminescent backlight, and water resistance to 100 meters (330 feet).



With the launch of its first watch in November 1974, Casio entered the wristwatch market at a time when the watch industry had just discovered digital technology. As a company with cutting-edge electronic technology developed for pocket calculators, Casio entered this field confident that it could develop timepieces that would lead the market.

Today, Casio is focusing its efforts on solar-powered radio-controlled watches: the built-in solar battery eliminates the nuisance of replacing batteries, atomic timekeeping means the users never have to reset the time. Recently, Casio launched a series of Bluetooth watches that sync to the users cell phone to automatically update the time. Casio is always moving time forward.

2363,"Quality Japanese Automatic movement; Functions without a battery; Powers automatically with the movement of your arm Mineral crystal Case diameter: 49 mm Stainless-steel case; Black dial; Date function Water-resistant to 300 M (1000 feet)

Classically styled with powerful lines and featuring a precise Swiss-made automatic watch movement, the shock-resistant Invicta Grand Diver men's stainless steel watch is made for serious scuba fanatics with a water resistance rating to 300 meters (nearly 1000 feet). This large, round watch measures 47mm wide (1.85 inches) and 17mm thick (0.67 inches) and it's made from solid surgical grade stainless steel. It also offers a skeleton see-through caseback and molded diving helmet logos on the end pieces connecting the silver stainless steel bracelet band as well as on the screw-down crown. It's topped by a black unidirectional rotating elapsed time bezel with white markings. The black dial face is supplemented by Tritnite luminous dotted markers and arrowhead-style hands (with seconds hand). Other features include an anti-reflective crystal with magnifier, date function at 3 o'clock, and diver's buckle with safety clasp.



Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

Tritnite is a luminous material with an extended glow exclusively developed by Invicta in Switzerland and added to their timepiece hands and markers. When exposed to regular daylight, it will hold its glow for about 20 hours.

About Invicta
Latin for ""invincible,"" Invicta was founded in La Chaux-de-fonds, Switzerland in 1837 by Raphael Picard, who believed that fine Swiss timepieces could be offered at modest prices. For more than a century, the company has created distinctive manual and automatic-winding pieces. In 1991, descendants of the Picard family reaffirmed the company's founding principle, and the invigorated Invicta has been growing ever since with one of the most widely diverse collections of precise Swiss timepieces on the market.

2383,"Every Gerber product has a story to tell. The story of the LMF II is one of resilience and resourcefulness, of being on the wrong side of sticky situation and living to tell the tale. The purpose driven design of this knife stems from the experience of former military man Jeff Freeman, combining thoughtful design features and life-saving application.

Originally designed to free an aircrew from a downed aircraft, the LMF II is tough enough to cut through the fuselage of an aircraft and smart enough to ensure you are safe while doing so. The knife has a purposeful break between the tang and the butt cap, providing insulated protection against stray wires and absorbing any shock from hammering.

This 10” survival knife was built to adapt to any scenario thrown at it – ensuring comfort, versatility, and safety when you need it most.

The Gerber 22-01629 LMF II Black Infantry Knife was designed for survival during even the worst conditions. This 10-inch survival knife was engineered by former military man Jeff Freeman and was field-tested with troops, ensuring that it can stand up to rugged, rigorous use and offer high performance under a variety of emergency conditions.



Unique Buttcap Can Pierce Glass
In addition to the blade end of the knife, Gerber also gave the LMF II a unique, pointed buttcap that is made of stainless steel. This heavy end can be used to pierce glass in the event you need to egress from a helicopter or other vehicle. The buttcap features a smart design that is physically separated from the tang in order to offer shock absorption when it's used as a hammer and also to prevent electrical shock.

Smart, Versatile, Comfortable Design
The LMF II features an overmolded handle, which helps prevent hand blisters and provides a secure grip. It is also designed with lashing holes, allowing it to be converted into a spear and extending its usability. The black color keeps you inconspicuous while you are out on night-time missions.

Sheath Included with Built-In Sharpener
A low-profile sheath is included and it features a built-in carbide sharpener. The stainless steel blade can withstand a ton of abuse, but if it ever gets damaged or needs sharpening, you won't be stuck out in the open with a dull knife. The sheath facilitates movement and attaches to a belt or MOLLE vest.

Gerber's History of Ingenuity
Savvy. Moxie. Craftsmanship. Attention to detail. These are just a few of the company traits that contributed to Gerber's emergence as a world leader in outdoor gear. Joseph Gerber started Portland, Oregon's Gerber Advertising back in 1910, and one Christmas, he hired a local knife-maker to craft 25 sets of kitchen cutlery as client gifts. The knives were so popular, Mr. Gerber ultimately left his agency to launch Gerber Legendary Blades in 1939.

For more than half a century, Gerber Legendary Blades has been helping people fend for themselves. Gerber designs popular, dependable tools and knives along with other outdoor gear that helps users accomplish whatever tasks they may be faced with, promoting the lost art of self-reliance.

About Coleman
More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.

In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.

2461,"Boeshield T-9 is a bicyclist’s best friend! Lubricate your bike chain, waterproof cables, and prevent rust with our effective all-in-one formula. Wet, dry, or in dirt, serious cyclists rely on one product to clean, lubricate and protect—Boeshield T-9 does it all. In the world of cycling, few terrains are off limits and endurance is essential, for both rider and equipment. A tough, long-lasting waterproof lubricant is crucial for safety and performance, whether you’re navigating dusty mountain trails or zipping along highways. T-9 flushes out dirt and old lubricants, displaces moisture and penetrates moving parts in between the rollers and pins on drive chains, carrying the paraffin formula deep into these areas and coating them thoroughly. T-9 dries to a clean, continuous wax film that performs better than Teflon and lasts up to 300 miles without picking up dust, dirt or mud. Boeshield T-9 was developed and licensed by global aerospace leader, The Boeing Company, to fill a need for high-performance, long-term metal protection and lubrication. T-9's rust preventative spray uses a unique formulation of solvent carrier and paraffin wax coating engineered to penetrate crevices deeply, displace moisture, dissolve minor corrosion, and leave a clean, waxy coating with lasting durability-without using Teflon, silicone, fluorocarbons, MEK, or acetone. Whether it be automotive, bicycle, industrial, lawn and garden, marine, RV or tools, T-9 continues to be the best option for rust prevention and waterproof lubrication. Use T-9 on: Drive Chains, Derailleur, Control Cables, Brake Cables, Shift Cables, Caliper Pivots, Pedal Pivots, Seat Posts, Spoke Nipples, Inside Frames

On a seafaring yacht, a dusty ATV, or a shower door, T-9 has you covered. Boeshield T-9 endures muddy bike trails, rain-soaked back roads, and salted highways. It withstands farmer’s fields, offshore oil rigs, and carpenter's workshops. For everyone from firefighters and road crews to cyclists and sailors, Boeshield T-9 is the proven solution. T-9 attacks existing corrosion, loosens rusty parts, and flushes out old lubricants. It is also extremely useful for drying wet parts, electrical motors and circuits, ignitions, and connectors. Apply T-9 and wipe off the excess for immediate use. T-9 dries to a waxy, waterproof finish without leaving a sticky film to attract dirt, dust, or mud. T-9 stays liquid long enough to permeate metal crevices and seep deep inside assembled components to leave a durable protective coating as well as lubricating and protecting-all without dismantling your equipment. Apply T-9 to any metal surface and let it dry. One simple step gives you a thin, penetrating film of durable, waterproof protection and lubrication that endures, months after month or mile after mile. T-9 dries to a clean, waxy, waterproof film that won't wash off in rain, puddles, or mud. You can rinse away sand, dust and grime with water, while leaving the lubricant intact. T-9 will not harm paint, plastic, rubber, fiberglass, or vinyl. It can be used on engines, wiring, and belts. T-9 is nonconductive and will not cause short circuits, so it's also safe to use on electronics. Use solvent or any emulsifying cleaner to easily remove T-9, or simply respray and allow T-9 to dissolve itself before wiping it off.

About Allen Bike Racks
In 1967, after a few years of working on the aerospace technology for the Apollo missions, Dick Allen was out of a job. Government cutbacks led Allen, a Harvard-trained physicist, to transform his garage hobby into a new industry. A cycling enthusiast, inventor, and family man, Allen had a personal need for a bike-carrying device. On weekends, he would take his sons and wife to Cape Cod or the White Mountains of New Hampshire. What proved difficult time and again was the transport of his familys bicycles. Rather than fight through inconvenience with twine and a dinged car, Allen sought an answer for himself as well as a market in which he foresaw major growth possibilities.

Always a pathfinder, Allen took to work in his Lincoln, Massachusetts garage in search of a more efficient way to transport bikes. Drafting designs during the day and constructing them throughout the night, he put together a model made of electrical conduit, metal strapping, and fire hose casings (for padding). At first, the Allens tested the prototype on weekend excursions. Finding the first trunk-mounted rack to be a success, Dick started Allen Bike Racks. Dealer acceptance came quickly, and by 1971 Allen Bike Racks were sold nationally through a number of major bicycle distributors. Today, the company owns over three dozen patents and offers a versatile product line of bike racks while Dicks son Alex now owns and operates the business. What started out as a small garage run operation now operates three warehouses nationally, two factories abroad, and has products sold in more than a dozen countries around the world.

Smith's 3001 10"" diamond sharpening steel is the world's first interrupted surface diamond sharpening steel.

A fine grade real monocrystalline diamond is bonded in a nickel plate over the oval shape of the stee to produce a long-lasting surface that will produce a razor sharp edge on the toughest of stainless steels. A comfortable soft-grip handle and oversized safety hand guard are features not seen on any other sharpening steel. A convenient hang-up ring is added for easy storage. For more than 100 years Smith's has been in the knife and tool sharpening business. We pride ourselves on our industry reputation as The Edge Experts and today offer a full line of easy-to-use sharpeners from all five major sharpening categories: 100% Natural Arkansas Stones, Diamonds, Ceramics, Bonded Abrasives and Carbides.

2558,"The iBert safe-T-seat provides families with exactly what they are looking for in a childrens bike seat; comfort, safety, an attractive and innovative design, and a good position where the child can fully explore the scenery. Nestled safely between the adult?s arms and behind the protection of the bicycle handlebars, the child can look around and be involved with the ride with mom or dad by turning the padded steering wheel. Center mounted provides a better center of gravity and increased mobility for the adult rider. Better view and more enjoyable ride for the child. The child safely positioned behind the handlebars allows for better communication. Unlike trailers - no dirt, rocks or water thrown in the child?s face. Easier, safer loading and unloading of the child.

Created by parents who were disappointed with the family bicycling options available, the iBert Safe-T Front Mounted Child Bicycle seat was made to offer families the best biking experience possible in safety and comfort. This front mounted seat offers both parent and child excellent range of vision, with the opportunity to interact as they bike together. Noted for its ease of use, the seat takes just a few minutes to install and remove, and it is equally easy and safe to load and unload the child from the seat. Providing plenty of clearance for the knees so that the adult can bike with ease, the seat is positioned so that it is easy to maintain the center of gravity. This adaptable seat fits any adult bike with a minimum of 3/4 inches of clearance on the handlebar stem.

The iBert Safe-T seat was developed after its creators became frustrated with the available bike seat options for children. They found that bike trailers kept their kids uncomfortably far away from them, got too hot in the sun, and only provided a limited view out to the children. The rear-mounted seats presented similar problems. The kids had a limited view and it was difficult to interact with them. Additionally, the balance of the bike was off and it was not easy to load and unload the kids. Other front mounted seats were complicated to hook onto the bike and difficult to remove. These seats also did not allow knee clearance for biking, and as a result were not comfortable.

The iBert Safe-T seat offers a variety of safety and comfort advantages compared to other child bike seat options. The iBert Safe-T seat allows you to maintain control of the bike when loading and unloading your child. To load and unload the child, you simply straddle the bike and lift the child into or out of the seat. When using the iBert seat you can always see what your child is doing and you can make sure that your child is safe and comfortable at all times. The center of gravity in the iBert seat is closer to the center of the bike making it easier to control the bike as you ride. The seat sits higher on the bike and is smooth on the bottom so that even tall riders rarely brush the bottom of the seat with their knees and if they do they just glide along the smooth edges on the bottom.

The iBert Safe-T seat is easy to install. The patented stinger assembly attaches to any bike with a minimum of 3/4 inches on the handle bar stem. The stinger system attaches to the bike in just two minutes and the seat can then be attached and detached from the stinger in 15 seconds. If you buy additional stinger assemblies the seat can be attached to multiple bikes.

The iBert Safe-T seat is made in the U.S.A. with safety and quality as the main objectives. While the iBert Safe-T seat is designed to meet all 1625-00 standards, at this time ASTM 1625-00 is written for rear child carriers not front mounted seats.

About Planet Bike
In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment.

Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact.

Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

Kraton, is a superior handle material that Cold Steel has employed for decades because its robust traction and resiliency allows it to withstand the shock of even the hardest blows.

2729,"Our new Counter TAC™ boot knives were designed with this simple philosophy in mind. The full tang blades are made from beautifully polished AUS 8A Stainless steel that’s vacuum heat treated, and sub zero quenched for strength. They are hollow ground and end in a sturdy but needle sharp point that’s ideal for effortless penetration, and of course the edge is razor sharp. The ergonomic design of the Kraton grip is comfortable and adaptable to any fighting style, and the deeply textured surface and double guard will insure that the knife is not likely to slip from your hand under any circumstances. Finally, each Counter TAC™ is shipped with a state of the art Secure-Ex sheath, complete with a removable boot/belt clip and lashing slots so you can carry or conceal it just about anywhere.

2730,"Since starting Spyderco we've been told our knives are different, peculiar, even out there. All true. Thinking beyond established knife industry barriers allowed us to introduce new and radical innovations to the knife culture including: One-hand opening, serrations on a folder and a clip to attach a knife to a pocket. We didn't go into business to rake in a mountain of dough we're here for more selfish reasons- indulging our passion for creating knives. Spyderco is definitely out of the norm in the knife industry in our dedication to researching and developing fresh, improved and better performing materials all with function and reliability being key. Someone once said to Sal Glesser, Spyderco's owner, ""You must design in the dark because your knives look so strange."" True again. Our recognizable appearance is a result of designing ergonomic functional tools rather than applying lipstick and nylons to a pocketknife. We may look curious, homely, whatever, but we'll never be called unusable or undependable. Making knives that consistently deliver reliable high-performance requires an ongoing commitment to testing. In our million-dollar testing facility we examine edge retention with a CATRA machine, look for rust development with Q-FOG, check the force needed to open and close a knife. We also repeatedly test for stress, wear, optimal heat-treating and actively search for higher quality, performance enhancing steels and materials. As a customer you probably don't think about this, or much care, but it allows us to put forth a promise. When you purchase a Spyderco you are buying a high-quality reliable cutting tool designed and manufactured for peak performance and ergonomic comfort. Those Who Know Carry Spyderco.

It's good for both mountain biking as well as high-performance road riding. The folks at Rock 'n' Roll say this one gives the best chain performance in terms of making your shifting faster. Gold lube makes a geared bike feel like a fixed-gear; the movement is that smooth. Like the Extreme, the Gold has a gel membrane suspended in the fluid. The membrane seeps deep into the rollers and stays there, keeping the metal parts flexing, moving smoothly, shifting crisply, and doing everything quietly.Rock 'n' Roll lube cleans and lubes at the same time. Dribble it on by putting the bike in its biggest gear and backpedal. Drip from the top over the chainring or cog. Wipe off the excess. Shift to the small ring in front to wipe off the big ring. Wipe till the chain shines. You can ride right away, but letting the excess evaporate for a few hours or overnight is best. Rock 'n' Roll recommends not re-lubing until you hear squeaking. If you have more than one Rock 'n' Roll lube in your tool chest, you can put on the thicker formulations when it's wet and then apply the thinner when its dry and you don't have to degrease in between.Rock 'n' Roll Gold Lube comes in a 16oz. bottle and should last you for several seasons.Please Note: Per UPS regulations, ORM-D items such as this must ship via surface transport: UPS Ground or UPS Standard (Canada).

That’s thanks to SOG Assisted Technology (S.A.T.), a system of opposing high-tension coils that propels the blade open instantly once you give it a flick.

The Flash II 3.5"" Knife has got to be one of the coolest knives we’ve ever seen. Forget its wicked-quick blade access, that it handles like a race car on rails, or that it locks up like Alcatraz. It just looks and feels extraordinary. The Flash family of knives feature SOG Assisted Technology (S.A.T.), which employs a powerful piston lock that is easily released with a sliding button. We also had the foresight to incorporate an additional safety lock that gives added security when the blade is closed. Note that when the safety shows red, you are ready to go!

2763,"Try the Trident once and you’ll never carry that other brand’s blade again. That’s our challenge to you.

The SOG Trident uses our well-proven means of delivering a knife blade to the open position with the new SOG Assisted Technology. Now using our patent pending Arc-Actuator, the Trident locks stronger and releases easier. There is also a built-in safety to lock the blade closed. What also makes the Trident so unique is the patent pending Groove in the handle to cut paracord, fishing line, etc. without having to open the blade. The handle also includes a Digi-Grip variable pattern for coarser grip in areas that require it. Our bayonet style clip is easily switched for right and left hand carry or removed for pouch storage.

2766,"The SOG Specialty Knives & Tools TF6-CP Trident is a unique, versatile and fast opening folding knife that provides many different uses, while showcasing SOG’s style and quality construction. Made of AUS-8 steel with an attractive satin finish, the 3.75-inch straight edge, folding blade has a tanto shape with a very strong tip that's ideal for piercing, sharpens easily and makes quick work of any task. SOG Assisted Technology (S.A.T.) works through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs. As you initiate the opening action, the force propelling your blade open becomes greater than the force keeping it closed. The result is a blade that springs open instantly once it is engaged, seemingly on its own. The piston locking mechanism uses a movable bar that's wedged between the blade tang and knife handle to lock the blade in place while in the open position. The ergonomically contoured and well-balanced handle has a black finish and is made of a high strength, abrasion and impact resistant glass-reinforced nylon that will fit comfortably in your hand. The Digi-Grip variable pattern provides a secure, no-slip grip and the base of the handle sports a groove that allows the user to cut paracord, fishing line and other cord-sized objects without having to open the blade. The reversible belt clip provides a low and discrete carry for right and left handed users or can be removed for pouch storage. The TF6-CP has a closed length of 4.75-inches, overall length of 8.5-inches, blade thickness of 0.13-inches and weighs 3.6-ounces. The SOG TF6-CP Trident Knife comes with a limited lifetime warranty. Each SOG product is created with the help of company founder and chief engineer, Spencer Frazer. Known for their uncompromising style and performance, these knives and tools showcase innovation, dependability and a unique, futuristic style that has garnered awards and recognition worldwide.

Blending elements from the Bowie, Tomcat, SEAL Pup, and Flash Series knives, SOG Specialty Knives and Tools has created a new breed of folding knife: the TF-6 Trident Knife with straight-edge blade and tanto edge. Designed for use by Navy SEALs, the TF-6 features SOG's grooved handle, which allows you to cut heavy cord and cable without having to open the specially designed blade. The TF-6's blade is easy to open and features Arc-Actuator technology, which helps the blade lock more strongly and release more easily.



S.A.T. knives offer security and peace of mind with their locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access than other knives'. For Trident Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be quickly released with a sliding button. An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed, and for easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to be opened.

Cryogenic Heat Treatment for a Sharp, Dependable Blade
The TF-6 offers a full, 3.75-inch AUS8 stainless steel blade. Because the workhorse of any knife is its cutting surface, SOG's proprietary Cryogenic Heat Treatment process ensures that its blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and requires reducing the blade's temperature to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then slowly bringing it back up to room temperature. The stress created by this process strengthens the stainless steel at the atomic level and increases the blade's overall durability and edge retention.

Ergonomic, Lightweight Design Ensures Comfortable Use
Even if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make precise cuts if your knife doesn't fit comfortably in your hand. That's why this knife's handle is ergonomically contoured. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle is well-balanced and features SOG's unique Digi-Grip texturing, a feature that gives you gripping power where you need it most. Additionally, the grooved handle allows you to cut heavy cord and cable without having to open the blade.

At just 3.6 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible. The removable clip is easily switched for right/left hand-carry.

This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.

Compare These Elliptical Trainers



Elliptical trainers are compatible for all ages and fitness levels and allow you to select the difficulty level through the incline and intensity settings. Additionally, elliptical trainers allow you to determine the complexity of your workout based on your needs, all while listening to music, watching television, or reading a magazine while exercising in the comfort and safety of your own home.

Although different types of elliptical trainers offer an assortment of features, many of them include an array of challenging programs, forward and reverse directional movement, EKG grip pulse handles, a lightweight portable design with easy fold-up capability, and a monitor displaying calories burned, distance, speed, time, and heart rate. Other types of exercise machines, namely treadmills and bikes, offer excellent cardiovascular exercise and muscular training for the legs in a forward-motion exercise. Elliptical trainers take this to the next level by offering an upper and lower body workout with dual motion, challenging and diverse programs, and a low-impact exercise machine that won't strain sensitive joints.

M16-14D Desert Big Dog has an aluminum frame M16 in desert camo. The contoured handles of 6061 T6 aluminum are hard anodized Desert Tan.

It also features our automated liner safety. Automated liner safety is the locking liner safety innovation taken to the next level. The automated liner safety sets a pin between the locking liner and the frame. This pin acts as an additional layer of safety, so the locking liner is less likely to disengage during use.

To close the knife, pull the red buttoned safety lever back, slide the locking liner over, and fold the blade into the closed position. Want one of the most secure safety systems on the market? The choice is automatic.

One-hand opening and closing is quick and smooth, the result of precision tolerances and lubrous washers at the blade pivot. The dual ambidextrous thumb studs with checkered surfaces provide instant access in any circumstance. Please note: These knives are not designed for tip-up in-pocket carry.

About Eureka!
Though the exact year is unknown, Eureka’s long history begins prior to 1895 in Binghamton, New York, where the company still resides today. Then known as the Eureka Tent & Awning Company, its first wares were canvas products--most notably, Conestoga wagon covers and horse blankets for nineteenth century American frontiersmen--as well as American flags, store awnings, and camping tents.

The company increased production of its custom canvas products locally throughout the 1930s and during the 1940 and even fabricated and erected the IBM ""tent cities"" just outside Binghamton. The seven acres of tents housed thousands of IBM salesmen during the company’s annual stockholders meeting, which had since outgrown its previous locale. In the 1940s, with the advent of World War II and the increased demand for hospital ward tents, Eureka expanded operations and began shipping tents worldwide. Ultimately, upon the post-war return of the GIs and the resultant housing shortage, Eureka turned its attention to the home front during the 1950s by supplying awnings for the multitude of mobile homes that were purchased.

In 1960, Eureka’s new and innovative Draw-Tite tent, with its practical, free standing external frame, was used in a Himalayan Expedition to Nepal by world renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person documented to summit Mt. Everest only six years earlier. In 1963, Eureka made history during its own Mt. Everest ascent, with more than 60 of its tents sheltering participants from fierce 60+ mph winds and temperatures reaching below -20°F during the first all American Mt. Everest Expedition.

For backpackers and families, Eureka introduced its legendary Timberline tent in the 1970s. Truly the first StormShield design, this completely self-supporting and lightweight backpacking tent became one of the most popular tents the entire industry with sales reaching over 1 million by its ten year anniversary.

Eureka tents have also traveled as part of several historic expeditions, including the American Women’s Himalayan Expedition to Annapurna I in 1978 and the first Mt. Everest ascents by a Canadian and American woman in 1986 and 1988. In recent history, tents specially designed and donated by Eureka sheltered Eric Simonson and his team on two historic research expeditions to Mount Everest, this time in a quest for truth regarding the 1924 attempted summit of early English explorers George Mallory and Andrew Irvine. During the 1999 expedition, the team made history finding the remains of George Mallory, but the complete mystery remained unsolved. Returning in 2001 to search for more clues, the team found amazing historical artifacts which are now on display at the Smithsonian.

Selecting a Tent
Fortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Expect the Worst
In general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.

Three- and Four-Season Tents
For summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.

For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.

Domes and Tunnels
Tents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.

Size Matters
Ask yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.

Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.

About Planet Bike
In November of 1996, Planet Bike was founded in Madison, Wisconsin. In many ways, Planet Bike began as a social experiment that dedicated itself to doing business in a different way. Instead of being just another company that develops and sells products with profit as its end goal, Planet Bike wanted to help bring about positive change for people, their communities, and the environment.

Despite being a simple machine, the people at Planet Bike have always believed that the bicycle has great potential to help improve the world and the lives of the people in it. From the start, they have embraced an alternative corporate purpose which seeks to help get more people on bicycles by making communities friendlier places for the self-propelled. By donating 25% of company profits to causes that promote and facilitate bicycle usage, Planet Bike hopes to make an impact.

Social experiments aside, Planet Bike was born from the heart of a cyclist with a goal of making innovative, high quality, and practical bicycle accessories. Simply put, they strive to design and develop the best bicycle products in the world. In the company's short ten year history, they have made important product innovations within the bicycle industry. Advancements include the 4-line computer which is now a standard in the industry and the world's first self-contained HID light. Not bad for a company that ten years ago started as a one man operation. Today, while still a small company, Planet Bike continues to evolve and improve their product line with the goal of always striving to build accessories that make it easier for people to ride their bikes. Since 1996, Planet Bike's financial support of the grassroots bicycle movement has totaled $500,000. By 2010, they have made a goal to donate $1 million to organizations that are dedicated to making America a friendlier place for cyclists.

About Perfect Fitness
The training principles and innovations behind the Perfect Pushup originated with Alden Mills, a seven year veteran of the US Navy SEALs. While serving as platoon commander, Aldens platoon was chosen for a study to determine why SEALs suffered unusually high injury rates. After learning the injuries were linked to age-old training methods, SEAL trainers switched to Functional Training. Alden learned firsthand how to incorporate these lessons into exercise routines that have become the foundation of techniques used at Perfect Fitness.

About Izzo
Prior to 1991, millions of golfers had to endure the pain of shouldering a bag on a single strap for 18 exhausting holes. Feeling their pain, T. J. Izzo sought to eliminate fatigue by creating the Izzo Dual Strap System. This simple, brilliant innovation made walking the course easier, golf more enjoyable. In fact, Frank Thomas, technical director of the USGA, hailed the Izzo Dual Strap as one of the four greatest innovations in modern golf. Today, 100 percent of all carry bags use a dual strap, and millions of golfers are enjoying the walk thanks to Izzo innovation.

Now, charged by that spirit of innovation and a quest for quality, the Izzo Product Development and Quality Teams, all avid golfers, apply their unparalleled knowledge and passion for the game to deliver unique, superior quality products that can help every level of golfer.

About Kent Sporting Goods Company
Over 50 years ago, the Kent Sporting Goods Company was founded as a subsidiary of Eagle Rubber Company, a manufacturer of football gear, helmets, and uniforms, based in Batesville, Mississippi. In 1959, the company moved to New London, Ohio. Some of the first products to come off the manufacturing line were U.S. Coast Guard-approved life jackets, golf bags, bowling bags, and outdoor lawn games and accessories.

In 1981, under new ownership, the Kent brand became a major factor in the Type I kapok commercial vest market and Type II commodity market. About a year later, a small company in Celina, Ohio, with a brand niche in water skis, ropes, and vests, approached Kent and asked them to manufacture their ski vests. This was the beginning of Kent's quest to be a major player in the water sports, marine, and PFD (personal flotation device) industry.

Starting in 2001, the shareholders of Kent started several corporations that acquired the assets of other popular water sports corporations and their respective brands. Some of these include Connelly, CWB, HO, Hyperlite, O'Brien, Liquid Force, Straight Line, and Wakekite, all specializing in a full line of high-action recreational water sports products including wakeboards, kneeboards, kiteboards, towable tubes, skis, ropes, and life jackets. These products can be found at most specialty shops, pro shops, and big box retailers.

In 2009, Kent introduced two other innovative brands to the marketplace under the Absolute Outdoor corporation marketed as Full Throttle and Onyx. Full Throttle is a premium water sports brand featuring life jackets, tubes, wakeboards, and kneeboards for today's active lifestyles. Onyx is an outdoor recreation brand consisting of rainwear, paddling vests, and inflatable PFDs for fishing and hunting, all designed to keep you outdoors longer.

Today, Kent and its controlled group of companies offer a multi-brand portfolio of water sports and marine products. These companies and brands provide innovative, well-designed, functional gear for the water sports and outdoor enthusiasts looking to satisfy their active lifestyle and water or outdoor activities.

Kent Sporting Goods Company is located in New London, Ohio.

Each standard tie-down has a break strength of 2,500 pounds with 833 pounds of safe working load, while each stainless steel has a break strength of 1,500 pounds with 500 pounds of safe working load.

Self-storing straps are made from 2-inch seatbelt-quality polyester web and extend up to 43 inches. They automatically retract to hold the boat snug to the trailer. It features a simple built-in ratchet with SUR-Grip rubber-grip handle with release lever that can be used with just one hand. Vinyl coating on the hooks protects your boat’s finish. One-bolt installation makes the BoatBuckle part of your trailer so it won’t get lost like conventional tie-downs.

BoatBuckle brand tie-down systems offer professional fishermen and weekend boaters convenient, high quality tie-down systems so they can spend more time on the water and less time on the boat ramp. IMMI is the leading marine tie-down manufacturer in North America.
