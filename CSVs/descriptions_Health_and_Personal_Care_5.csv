10,"This AA flashlight with holster Pack carries on your hip and comes from trusted MagLite—another another super-duty beam that's built tough. It has standard rugged machined aluminum construction, with shock and water resistance for long life. It’s anodized inside and out, too, for increased resistance to corrosion. Plus, the spot-to-flood light adjustability allows you to choose how you want to focus the light. There's a spare lamp included as well, safely packed underneath the tail cap. It comes equipped with a rugged nylon holster that's weather-resistant and easy to attach, and accepts up to a 2 3/4-inch-wide belt. The flashlight measures 5 3/4-by-23/32-inches (length by width) and weighs just under 4 ounces. It runs on two ""AA"" batteries (which are included).

With its high-intensity adjustable light beam and compact size, the Mini Maglite Two-Cell AA Flashlight and Holster Combo Pack offers limitless around-the-house and on-the-go options. This slender flashlight succeeds where flimsy plastic flashlights fail, providing a steady, fast-focus stream of light wherever and whenever you need it. For easy portability, the flashlight comes with a nylon holster with belt loop.



With an overall length of only 5.75 inches and a weight of just 3.8 ounces (with included batteries), the Mini Maglite is easy to handle and hold, even when working in tight spaces.

Its small size and included holster also makes it ultra-portable and perfect for emergency storage, hiking, camping, and thousands of other uses, so you're never caught without a flashlight when you need one.

Three Light Modes for Versatility
The Mini Maglite boasts a unique candle mode that allows you to remove the head and expose the bulb to shed light in all directions, just like a candle. You can flip the head over and place it on a solid surface to create a sturdy holder for the ""candle""--a great option when you're camping, at an outdoor concert, or entertaining after dark in your backyard.

This handy flashlight also has spot and flood modes--simply rotate the head half a turn to choose the light intensity you need.

Durably Constructed for a Lifetime of Use
The Mini Maglite features solid, precision-machined, high-strength aluminum construction that resists wear and tear, even after years of use. Anodized inside and out for corrosion resistance, this flashlight has rubber O-rings for water and shock resistance.

For further durability, a patented vented tail cap reduces the chance of gas buildup. The tail cap also stores a spare lamp, so you'll always have light when you need it.

The Mini Maglite is backed by a limited lifetime warranty.

Maglite: An Icon of American Ingenuity
Prior to the introduction of the Maglite flashlight in 1979, flashlights were generally regarded as unreliable, throw-away items. That all changed when Anthony Maglica revolutionized the portable lighting industry with his unique technology. By combining superior design with reliability, durability, and an unprecedented lifetime warranty, Maglite produces reliable, iconic flashlights that are designed exclusively in the USA and are built by American workers.

63,"Intense vaginal itching and burning happen to many women at one time or another. In fact, there are over 60 things that could be causing that itch.

With patented SmartControl® Technology.

If You Smoke:
More than 10 cigarettes per day: start with step 1.
10 or less cigarettes per day: start with step 2.
14 Opaque Patches.

When you decide to quit smoking, NicoDerm CQ with SmartControl can give you 24-hour defense against cravings. NicoDerm CQ is the only clear patch specially formulated with patented SmartControl technology that helps provide a controlled release of therapeutic nicotine for 24 hours* to help fight cravings all day long. The patented SmartControl technology includes an extra layer which ensures that all the nicotine will not be delivered at once or run out too soon. You can choose to wear the patch for 16 or 24 hours each day, so you get continuous protection against cravings--even if you get early morning cravings when you first wake up.



Soon the brain's chemical structure actually changes. It becomes hooked into wanting more and more nicotine to make the effects last. When the brain stops getting the nicotine it's used to, we begin to feel withdrawal cravings--actually the brain craving nicotine.

As this nicotine addiction sets in, the brain links everyday habits with smoking, boosting the role of cigarettes. Normal everyday activities begin to trigger the urge to smoke. Drinking coffee in the morning. Talking on the phone. Work breaks. Driving.

So when you try to quit smoking, you're actually fighting a battle on two fronts: 1) physical--that is, nicotine addiction--and 2) habitual, the activities, moods and events linked with smoking.





First, cravings. Once you stop smoking, that's when your brain really starts screaming for nicotine. Your withdrawal cravings can actually intensify in the days after you quit. That's where Therapeutic Nicotine--like that from NicoDerm CQ--is proven effective. The SmartControl technology helps provide a controlled release of nicotine, ensuring that all of the nicotine will not be delivered at once, or run out too soon. It is delivered steadily and evenly through your skin, without the harmful carcinogens that cigarettes contain.

This controlled release of nicotine shields you from the harsh effects of nicotine withdrawal, working as a temporary aid to help you quit smoking.

To help you change those smoking habits, NicoDerm CQ includes online behavioral support from Committed Quitters. Enrollment is free--and you'll receive an individualized multiweek stop-smoking plan tailored to your specific needs, designed to help you quit smoking for good. You'll also get support and tips to help you along the way. Committed Quitters has been clinically proven to improve success rates when combined with NicoDerm CQ.





Start with the right treatment plan: Different smokers are used to different nicotine levels. That's why NicoDerm CQ offers two different treatment options.

Get an individualized stop-smoking plan from Committed Quitters: Your plan can help you overcome your unique barriers to quitting smoking--and increase your chances of success. For example, if you're used to having a cigarette with your morning coffee, you'll get specific advice on overcoming that habit and desire. Look for information in your package of NicoDerm CQ with SmartControl, or visit CommittedQuitters.com.

Follow your step-down plan: Both the ten-week and eight-week programs are designed to help you gradually step down over a full course of therapy. As you use NicoDerm CQ with SmartControl, you'll feel your cravings start to diminish as it helps your body gradually wean itself off nicotine. Following the program, you lower your dosage until you are free of both nicotine and cigarettes.

129,"For use with the Clearblue Fertility Monitor, the Clearblue Fertility Monitor Test Stick pack includes 30 individually wrapped test sticks. The majority of women who are trying to get pregnant will need 10 test sticks each cycle. Women with irregular or long cycles may have to use 20 test sticks each cycle. The Clearblue Fertility Monitor comes from the #1 OB-GYN ovulation recommended brand*** and is proven to increase the chances of getting pregnant by 82% in the first cycle of use*. It's designed to identify all your fertile days**, typically up to 6, which is more days than traditional ovulation predictor kits. This discrete, feminine, handheld fertility monitor tracks two key fertility hormones, estrogen and luteinizing hormone, it shows your fertility information on the easy to use touch screen as well as summarizing up to 6 cycles data on one screen for easy comparison.



To use the Clearblue® Fertility Monitor – the #1 brand recommended by OB/GYNs – to maximize your chances of getting pregnant, you will need to purchase the Clearblue Fertility Monitor Test Sticks separate from the device. Clearblue Fertility Monitor Test Stick packs include 30 individually wrapped test sticks. The majority of women will need 10 test sticks each cycle. Women with irregular or long cycles may have to use 20 test sticks each cycle.

Taking conception to the next level, the Clearblue Fertility Monitor maximizes a woman’s chances of conceiving a baby by identifying 3x more fertile days compared to traditional ovulation tests. This electronic, hand-held monitor tracks a woman’s personal cycle, detecting two key ovulation hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH) and estrogen. Using the two hormones, the device can pinpoint not only a woman’s 2 peak fertility days, but also 1-5 additional high fertility days prior to ovulation – for a total of up to 6 fertile days.

There are only a few days per cycle when a woman is fertile and can conceive. The following chart outlines the phases of a woman’s menstrual cycle, showing how the two most fertile days coincide with the LH surge (24-36 hours before ovulation) and the release of an egg (ovulation). These are a woman’s 2 best days to conceive a baby.



However, it is generally acknowledged that sperm can survive up to 5 days in the sperm-supportive mucus found in a woman’s body during the fertile days of her cycle meaning there is a fertile window of typically up to 6 days: 5 days before ovulation plus the day of ovulation. Traditional ovulation tests like Clearblue Digital Ovulation Test track the LH hormone and identify a 2 day window of fertility. But the Fertility Monitor also tracks estrogen levels, which rise just before the LH surge, extending the fertile window typically up to 6 days. This extended window can help to reduce the time it takes to conceive2 as it gives more days to try, plus gives advance notice of the 2 peak days.



The Fertility Monitor is easy to use and gives you clear accurate results.



Low fertility = very small chance of conceiving
High fertility = increased chance of conceiving
Peak fertility = highest chance of conceiving

When you’re ready to test for pregnancy, choose a brand and product you can trust. In the Clearblue Pregnancy Test Buying Guide, we outline the different features of pregnancy tests so you can feel maximum confidence throughout the entire conception process.

As the diagram above illustrates, timing is key when trying to conceive a baby. While there are manual charting and calculator methods that may be used to predict ovulation, these methods often fall short. They require tracking a woman’s typical cycle length over several months. However, every woman’s cycle is unique and cycles for any one woman can vary from cycle to cycle – making calendar-based predictions unreliable prediction as well as time-consuming. That’s why Clearblue provides a range of products to help predict ovulation without months of charting.

131,"The Clearblue Fertility Monitor helps reduce the time it takes to conceive your baby. This handheld digital monitor is the only product to track two key fertility hormones and store your personal cycle information. The optical reader assesses hormone changes in your urine to clearly identify your fertility status every day. The Clearblue Fertility Monitor has been shown to accurately predict ovulation when compared to fertility specialist tools such as serum hormone measurements and vaginal ultrasound scans, but testing can be done at home and at a fraction of the cost.



Taking conception to the next level, the Clearblue® Fertility Monitor maximizes a woman’s chances of conceiving a baby by identifying 3x more fertile days compared to traditional ovulation tests. The #1 brand recommended by OB/GYNs, this electronic, hand-held monitor tracks a woman’s personal cycle, detecting two key ovulation hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH) and estrogen. Using the two hormones, the device can pinpoint not only a woman’s 2 peak fertility days, but also 1-5 additional high fertility days prior to ovulation – for a total of up to 6 fertile days.

There are only a few days per cycle when a woman is fertile and can conceive. The following chart outlines the phases of a woman’s menstrual cycle, showing how the two most fertile days coincide with the LH surge (24-36 hours before ovulation) and the release of an egg (ovulation). These are a woman’s 2 best days to conceive a baby.



However, it is generally acknowledged that sperm can survive up to 5 days in the sperm-supportive mucus found in a woman’s body during the fertile days of her cycle meaning there is a fertile window of typically up to 6 days: 5 days before ovulation plus the day of ovulation. Traditional ovulation tests like Clearblue Digital Ovulation Test track the LH hormone and identify a 2 day window of fertility. But the Fertility Monitor also tracks estrogen levels, which rise just before the LH surge, extending the fertile window typically up to 6 days. This extended window can help to reduce the time it takes to conceive2 as it gives more days to try, plus gives advance notice of the 2 peak days.



The Fertility Monitor is easy to use and gives you clear accurate results.



Low fertility = very small chance of conceiving
High fertility = increased chance of conceiving
Peak fertility = highest chance of conceiving

When you’re ready to test for pregnancy, choose a brand and product you can trust. In the Clearblue Pregnancy Test Buying Guide, we outline the different features of pregnancy tests so you can feel maximum confidence throughout the entire conception process.

As the diagram above illustrates, timing is key when trying to conceive a baby. While there are manual charting and calculator methods that may be used to predict ovulation, these methods often fall short. They require tracking a woman’s typical cycle length over several months. However, every woman’s cycle is unique and cycles for any one woman can vary from cycle to cycle – making calendar-based predictions unreliable prediction as well as time-consuming. That’s why Clearblue provides a range of products to help predict ovulation without months of charting. You can learn more about predicting ovulation and which method is right for you in our Ovulation Test Buying Guide.

Each NicoDerm CQ patch contains a special nicotine rate-controlling membrane that controls the release of nicotine into your bloodstream through your skin. The level of nicotine uptake is lower than that of cigarettes, and the program is designed to allow your body to gradually adjust to having less nicotine until you don’t need any.

3 Step Program

NicoDerm® CQ® is a three step program.  You start with the highest level of medicine and gradually step down your dose.  Reduce withdrawal symptoms, including nicotine craving, associated with quitting smoking

If you smoke 10 or less cigarettes per day, start with Step 2.

What is the NicoDerm® CQ® Patch and How is it Used?
NicoDerm® CQ® is a small, nicotine-containing patch.  When you put on a NicoDerm® CQ® patch, nicotine passes through the skin and into your body.  NicoDerm® CQ® is very thin and uses special material to control how fast nicotine passes through the skin.  Unlike the sudden jolts of nicotine delivered by cigarettes, the amount of nicotine you receive remains relatively smooth throughout the 24 or 16 hours period you wear the NicoDerm® CQ® patch.  This helps to reduce the cravings you may have for nicotine.

2 Week Kit:  Free Personalized Stop Smoking Plan.  Committed Quitters® Program enrollment form, user's guide, audio tape and child resistant disposal try.

To Increase Your Success In Quitting:

Our walnuts are grown in orchards in California, and harvested in the fall where the shells are milled into a fine powder so they have specially rounded edges, which means a softer scrub.

179,"Rembrandt came to be when a dentist decided to make a better toothpaste. He began by dreaming about papayas. There's an enzyme in the papaya plant that naturally helps clean your teeth. This little enzyme, and a sprinkling of creative science, created something called Citroxain. An entirely new way of caring for your mouth was born. At Rembrandt, we believe having a healthy mouth goes beyond teeth and gums. We care about your entire mouth. It's this mouth of yours that literally tells the world who you are. With a little love and care, it can be brilliant. Deep cleans and whitens gently.







Now you can maintain a brighter, healthier smile without having to give up your favorite foods and beverages.



Q. How long does it take to see results from daily brushing with REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste?
A. It depends on the current color of your teeth. Some people see an immediate whitening effect. However, for teeth with a noticeable amount of stains, it can take longer to see a change in color. For those who already have very white teeth or have had a professional whitening service, REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste provides an excellent way to maintain the level of whiteness, especially when used in conjunction with other REMBRANDT daily whitening products.

Q. What makes REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste different/better than other whitening toothpastes on the market?
A. REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste has a unique, dual-action, proprietary formula specifically created to help lift tough stains from teeth while also helping prevent new stains from sticking to tooth enamel.



The REMBRANDT family of teeth whitening products includes five Daily Whitening products and two Fast Whitening products, as shown below, all designed to keep your teeth looking healthy and bright:

180,"The Ultrasonex rechargeable toothbrush supercharges your dental hygiene routine, removing far more plaque than even the most manic manual brushing could achieve. Alternating 1.6 MHz ultrasonic and 18,000 SPM carrier waves, the ""dual frequency"" action purports to reach below the gum line to prevent gingivitis and bleeding. (More likely, it's the 18,000 strokes per minute that does the trick.) It's certainly true that the Ultrasonex leaves teeth as clean as they'll feel short of a trip to the dentist. The charge lasts for up to 4 days, making it easy to bring along on short trips. The ergonomically designed toothbrush feels good in the hand, and it even turns itself off automatically after three minutes--the amount of brushing time recommended by dentists. No cheating by shutting it off manually! --Mary Park

A 2-stage cutting action with lift and cut technology uses slots to cut long hairs and holes to shave stubble smooth, while the full-width pop-up trimmer handles the detail work. The integrated LED display shows shaving minutes remaining, plus cleaning and head replacement indicators. A 1-hour full-charge gives you 100 shaving minutes, while the 2-minute power-charge provides a 3-minute shave. When you're done, simply rinse clean. Includes deluxe leather pouch, stand, recharging power cord, cleaning brush and travel pouch. Automatic worldwide voltage adjustment. No. 8894XL. Imported. 5-1/2L"".

Licensed to shave closely and painlessly, this cord/cordless electric shaver is designated Norelco's James Bond model not only because it's high-tech but also because its heads can be adjusted to suit the sensitivity of 00-anyone's skin. The shaver has a comfort-control dial that varies the spring and pressure of the three floating heads through nine settings. Roger Moore might opt for a gentle setting, while Sean Connery surely would choose a firmer setting--and novices to grizzled veterans can please their faces as well. For this model, Norelco has also improved the lift and cut, below-skin shaving technology of its two-stage cutting system, which provides slots for longer hairs and holes for stubble while the floating heads are adjusting individually to facial contours. A full-width trimmer pops up for neat work on sideburns and mustaches.

More tech-chic comes in the form of a polymer LED display that tells how many minutes of shaving time remain when the shaver is operating cordless on its lithium-ion battery. The LED display also warns when the heads need cleaning (all it takes is a rinsing under running water) or replacing (replacement heads available separately). An audible alarm sounds when the shaver requires recharging on its storage stand. A six-minute quick charge is good for a single shave, and a one-hour full charge provides 100 minutes of cordless shaving. The shaver fits the hand beautifully and goes on the road stylishly in its leather travel pouch, while automatically adjusting to worldwide voltage variances. It carries a 60-day, full-satisfaction, money-back guarantee and a two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack

"
234,"Norelco's Quadra Shaving system provides unexpected closeness and convenience without the nicks and cuts of blades.

The three floating heads on this cord/cordless shaver adjust in multiple directions to fit facial contours while Norelco's Lift & Cut below-skin shaving technology employs a two-stage cutting system (slots for longer hairs and holes for stubble) to produce a close, smooth shave. A full-width trimmer pops up for neat work on sideburns and mustaches. Perfect for the traveling man because it works worldwide on 100-volt to 240-volt systems, the razor recharges fully in one hour for 45 minutes of cordless shaving time or quick-charges in six minutes for a three-minute shave. An LCD meter tells how many minutes of shaving time remain when the shaver is operating cordless, displays the charging level, signals when the shaver needs recharging, and indicates when cleaning is needed. (Rinsing under running water is all that's needed.) The shaver fits the hand comfortably and comes in a soft, molded-plastic travel case. It carries a 60-day, full-satisfaction, money-back guarantee and a two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack

Although your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day, no self-adjustment is necessary as the monitor intelligently adjusts to your changing conditions. The IntelliSense monitor uses fuzzy logic intelligence to sense both your systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, and the result is personalized inflation with every reading. Arm discomfort and misreading due to improper cuff inflation are virtually eliminated.

The OMRON monitor uses the oscillometric method of blood pressure measurement. This means the monitor detects your blood's movement through your brachial artery and converts the movements into a digital reading. At the push of a button, the monitor automatically fills the cuff with air, starts deflation, then displays your systolic, diastolic, and pulse readings on an extra large display panel.

281,"Check yourself before you wreck yourself! Accurate blood pressure and pulse rate are just a push button away! Taking your blood pressure is easy with this fully automatic Omron HEM-712C monitor. Simply wrap the cuff around your arm and press START. It automatically inflates with the push of button. In seconds, your blood pressure and pulse readings are shown on the digital display.

The Omron HEM-712C Automatic Blood Monitor with IntelliSense is one of the best-selling upper-arm blood pressure monitors. This monitor is incredibly easy to use -- simply wrap the cuff around your arm and press start. In seconds, your blood pressure and pulse readings are displayed on the large digital panel. Proven time and time again, Omron's IntelliSense technology ensures accurate, clinically-proven, and comfortable readings.



Place your arm on a table so that the cuff is positioned at the same level as your heart. Rest comfortably in a relaxed environment for at least 15 minutes prior to taking your blood pressure measurement. Once you feel relaxed, simply press the start button and remain still. The cuff will begin to inflate and numbers will appear on the display as the heart symbol flashes. When the measurement is complete, the cuff will deflate, and your blood pressure and pulse rate will display on the screen. If you need to stop the measurement at any time, simply press the on/off button and the monitor will immediately deflate. And remember, always consult your physician for specific information about your blood pressure.

What is IntelliSense?
The IntelliSense monitor inflates the cuff to the ideal level with each use -- you never have to make any adjustments to select an inflation level. This is especially convenient for hypertensive users and for people with certain arrhythmia or heart disorders because their blood pressure is so likely to fluctuate. The biggest advantage of using the IntelliSense technology is a personalized inflation, every time, for maximum comfort.

The Importance of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
Doctors, diabetes educators, physician assistants, nurses, and other healthcare professionals all recommend home blood pressure monitoring for various reasons. Home monitoring provides your healthcare professionals with better information to understand and manage your high blood pressure. Many types of hypertension can only be detected by monitoring your blood pressure at home, including:

Who would have ever thought one little sheet could do so much? With Bounce dryer sheets, your clothes will be so soft you may find others drawn toward you. But not because of static—cling, we’ve got that under control. You’ll also find your clothes with less lint and hair sticking around. This simple little sheet might just change the way you feel about laundry—and the way your laundry feels.

* Keep out of reach of toddlers & pets to avoid accidental ingestion.

**Make sure to remove Bounce sheets before wearing your gym shoes.

How does Bounce soften?
During the tumbling of the dryer, fabric-care agents are transferred from the Bounce dryer sheet to the surface of fabrics. These fabric-care agents have a lubricating effect on the fabric, causing fibers to feel smooth.

How does Bounce control static?
If your socks cling to each other and snap at you when you try to pull them apart, that’s static cling. Static is known to build up in the dryer when fabric fibers, especially synthetics, rub together, generating friction. As a result of the friction between fibers, electrons are transferred across surfaces resulting in a static charge and that annoying high-pitched sound when you touch them.

Bounce works in the dryer, where static happens. Softening ingredients are transferred from the Bounce dryer sheet to the surface of fabrics via heat and physical contact during the tumbling of the dryer. Lubricating fiber surfaces with Bounce fabric softener helps prevent the friction that leads to static charge.

Can I reuse my Bounce sheet?
Why would you? In the U.S., the average cost of our dryer sheets is just pennies per sheet, so you can afford to use a new one every time. Plus, you’ll get better softening and static control when using a new sheet in every dryer load, especially since most of the fabric conditioner is used up in one use. A reused sheet will not provide nearly the same great benefit as a new one.

How do I use Bounce with small loads, such as one blouse?
Bounce was developed to use in a full load of damp fabrics. Tossing a Bounce sheet in the dryer with only one wet or dry garment can lead to staining. If you’ve washed your blouse and want to dry it with a Bounce sheet, we suggest adding a damp bath towel to the load.

How do fabric-conditioner stains occur?
Too heavy concentration of fabric conditioner—single items or small loads need help distributing the fabric conditioner. Try adding a damp bath towel or other heavyweight fabric to help even it out.

Fabrics that attract fabric conditioner, like certain polyesters, are prone to spotting. Check your garment-care tag; it might recommend “no fabric softener.” If you have fabric-conditioner spotting on a garment, it might be prone to spotting.

Dry loads—Bounce was designed to be used with damp fabrics. Fabric-conditioner stains are usually temporary. To remove them, rub wet fabric/stained area with a bar of soap, then rewash the garment in warm water.

Is Bounce safe for my dryer?
You’re in luck! Yes, based on our testing, Bounce is safe for all major brands of North American dryers. The following manufacturers have approved Bounce for use in their dryers: Amana, GE, Inglis, Whirlpool, Kenmore, and Maytag.

Can I use Bounce in my washer?
No. Bounce was developed for use in the dryer.

Can I use Bounce on my baby’s clothes?
Bounce shouldn’t be used on children’s sleepwear or other garments labeled as flame-resistant because it might reduce flame resistance.

I’m sensitive to perfume. Can I still use Bounce?
Try Bounce Free & Sensitive. It’s dermatologist-tested and mild on skin.

Is Bounce safe for use on white clothes?
Yes, all Bounce products are safe for use on white clothing.

Convenient Poppac™ for discreet use whenever, whereverEasy-to-use lozenges clinically proven to help you quitMedicine lasts after the lozenge is gone  Commit Lozenge® Lozenge delivers strong, lasting medicine, providing controlled amounts of nicotine at a slower, less intense pace than cigarettes to help stop cravings before they start. It increases your chances of success by allowing you to focus your willpower on changing your behavior. Commit Lozenge is also the first stop-smoking aid that offers you different strengths based on how soon you smoke your first cigarette in the morning–a method leading experts believe is a better indicator of nicotine dependence.

If you're thinking about quitting smoking--even if it's not the first time you've tried --Commit Lozenge delivers strong, lasting medicine to help stop cravings before they start. Commit 4 mg Lozenge doubles your chance of quitting, even if you've tried before.*

And if you're worried about weight gain, you should know the Commit 4mg Lozenge can actually help reduce weight gain while you quit.** The Therapeutic Nicotine in Commit helps reduce your nicotine cravings and relieves some nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help you quit.



Soon the brain's chemical structure actually changes. It becomes hooked into wanting more and more nicotine to make the effects last. When the brain stops getting the nicotine it's used to, we begin to feel withdrawal cravings--actually the brain craving nicotine.

As this nicotine addiction sets in, the brain links everyday habits with smoking, boosting the role of cigarettes. Normal everyday activities begin to trigger the urge to smoke. Drinking coffee in the morning. Talking on the phone. Work breaks. Driving.

So when you try to quit smoking, you're actually fighting a battle on two fronts: 1) physical--that is, nicotine addiction--and 2) habitual, the activities, moods and events linked with smoking.





Let's start with cravings. Once you stop smoking, that's when your brain really starts screaming for nicotine. Your withdrawal cravings can actually intensify in the days after you quit. That's where Therapeutic Nicotine--like that in Commit--is proven effective. Absorbed through your mouth, the nicotine in Commit reduces your nicotine cravings and relieves some nicotine withdrawal symptoms, without the harmful tar or carbon monoxide found in cigarette smoke.

Commit Lozenges help stop cravings before they start, increasing your chances of success by allowing you to focus your willpower on changing your behavior.

That's where Committed Quitters comes in. Committed Quitters is an online resource that can give you an individualized stop-smoking plan to help change the behaviors that reinforce your habit. Enrolling is easy, and access is free for users of Commit Lozenge. You'll get a multiweek plan tailored to your specific needs, including tips to help you along the way, while Commit's strong medicine helps relieve withdrawal cravings. Commit plus Committed Quitters significantly increases your chance of quitting, even if you've tried before.





Start with the right strength. Commit is the first and only stop-smoking aid that offers you different strengths based on how soon you smoke your first cigarette in the morning--a method leading experts believe is a better measure of nicotine dependence.

Get an individualized stop-smoking plan from Committed Quitters. Your plan can help you overcome your unique barriers to quitting smoking--and increase your chances of success. For example, if you're used to having a cigarette with your morning coffee, you'll get specific advice on overcoming that habit and desire. Look for information in your package of Commit Lozenges, or visit CommittedQuitters.com.

Follow the Commit 12-week plan. Commit helps your body gradually adjust to less nicotine. Over a 12-week period, you will use fewer and fewer lozenges, as shown in the chart. But remember, it's designed for a 12-week course of therapy. And for the first six weeks, use at least nine Commit Lozenges a day.

Worried about weight gain? It's a real concern for many smokers. But it's small compared to the risks of smoking. And when you use the Commit 4 mg Lozenge, it can actually help reduce weight gain while you quit.**

Want more ways to take off those extra pounds? Develop new, healthy habits like eating right and exercising. Have low-calorie, healthy foods handy, chew slowly when you eat, and drink lots of water while you're quitting.

Simply wrap the cuff around your arm and press START. In seconds, your blood pressure and pulse are displayed on the large digital display.

Not only does the HEM-773AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor utilize Omron's patented IntelliSense technology, but it also features the innovative Easy-Wrap Cuff. No more messing with arm cuffs that are difficult to use. The Easy-Wrap cuff is designed for a quick and proper fit for any arm size between nine and 17 inches in circumference. Taking your blood pressure just got a little bit easier -- simply wrap cuff around your arm and press start. In seconds your blood pressure and pulse are displayed on the large digital panel. Proven time and time again, Omron's IntelliSense technology ensures accurate, clinically-proven, and comfortable readings. And with the two-person, 21 memory recall, you can track your blood pressure and pulse progress as you work towards a healthier lifestyle.



Place your arm on a table so that the cuff is positioned at the same level as your heart. Rest comfortably in a relaxed environment for at least 15 minutes prior to taking your blood pressure measurement. Once you feel relaxed, simply press the start button and remain still. The cuff will begin to inflate and numbers will appear on the display as the heart symbol flashes. When the measurement is complete, the cuff will deflate, and your blood pressure and pulse rate will display on the screen. If you need to stop the measurement at any time, simply press the on/off button and the monitor will immediately deflate. And remember, always consult your physician for specific information about your blood pressure.

What is IntelliSense?
The IntelliSense monitor inflates the cuff to the ideal level with each use -- you never have to make any adjustments to select an inflation level. This is especially convenient for hypertensive users and for people with certain arrhythmia or heart disorders because their blood pressure is so likely to fluctuate. The biggest advantage of using the IntelliSense technology is a personalized inflation, every time, for maximum comfort.

The Importance of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
Doctors, diabetes educators, physician assistants, nurses, and other healthcare professionals all recommend home blood pressure monitoring for various reasons. Home monitoring provides your healthcare professionals with better information to understand and manage your high blood pressure. Many types of hypertension can only be detected by monitoring your blood pressure at home, including:

Wrist blood pressure monitors are portable, accurate and simple to use.

The Omron HEM-629 Auto Inflate Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor uses Omron's patented IntelliSense technology, which inflates the wrist cuff to the ideal level with each use and offers fast, personalized, and automatic inflation for maximum comfort. No adjustments are required to select an inflation level--especially convenient for hypertensive users and for people with certain arrhythmia or heart disorders, because their blood pressure is more likely to fluctuate. And with the HEM -629's 60-memory recall with date and time stamp, as well as averaging capabilities for the last three readings, you can track your blood pressure and pulse progress as your work towards a healthier lifestyle. You'll have additional peace of mind knowing that the HEM-629 comes with a 5-year warranty.

Because the HEM-629 has a wrist cuff, it is particularly helpful if you have a larger than average sized arm. The monitor fits those with a wrist size of 5.25 to 8.5 inches, and it ensures easier and more comfortable use. Note, however, that a wrist monitor does require proper positioning of the device at the heart level. It is critical that when using a blood pressure monitor the cuff is the appropriate size and is properly applied. An ill-fitting cuff or an incorrectly-applied cuff can result in inaccurate readings. Consult your doctor or the included instructions for the proper application of the cuff.

Features rubber track webbing to help keep support in position. SIZING To choose your size, use flexible measuring tape and find the circumference around your body at your belly button. The support should fit snugly around your hips with the front of the support two-fingers width below your navel. An easy-to-use hook & loop closure keeps the belt securely fastened while in use and can be worn over or underneath clothing. Adjust the suspenders straps to fit securely on your shoulders without causing tension. Turn it into a back support belt by simply detaching the shoulder straps from the belt. HOW IT WORKS Ergodyne ProFlex Back Supports provide lower back support and abdominal support for lifting heavy objects. Tightening the back support belt enhances the body’s intra-abdominal pressure and moves the stress away from the spine. When the back support is on correctly, the worker will have additional support for lifting and is more likely to use proper posture. When not lifting, be sure to loosen the belt. Great for airport luggage handlers, warehouse/distribution employees, material handling, construction crews, maintenance, assembly/fabrication, landscaping/grounds and jobs that require heavy lifting. We cannot guarantee that wearing a back brace will prevent workplace injury or be a cure for lower back pain, but when used properly these supports will provide extra lumbar support, promote proper lifting techniques and help you through a work day of bending, twisting, and schlepping. Rest assured, we got your back

After 25 years and at least 30 positive epidemiological studies, we could fill a front-end loader with research that proves back support effectiveness. Bottom line is, smart companies big and small have learned the value of lock and load back support.

389,"Did you know Prilosec OTC’s Omeprazole can stop frequent heartburn before it begins? With one Prilosec OTC Omeprazole 20mg pill each day, you can be free from frequent heartburn for 24 hours. Heartburn happens when stomach acid refluxes into the esophagus. Prilosec OTC is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that can block heartburn at the source, so you don’t get heartburn in the first place. Prilosec OTC’s delayed-release formula helps it pass through the tough stomach acid, turning down acid production. Some other heartburn relief treatments only neutralize the stomach acid and provide less relief (less than 24 hours), while Prilosec OTC’s long lasting delayed-release formula can provide 24-hour frequent heartburn relief. Join more than 30 Million Americans and try Prilosec OTC - just 1 pill a day for 14 days and experience what zero heartburn feels like. Prilosec OTC is the #1 Doctor, Gastroenterologist and Pharmacist recommended frequent heartburn treatment for 15 straight years. It’s possible while taking Prilosec OTC. Use as directed for 14 days to treat frequent heartburn. Do not take for more than 14 days or more often than every 4 months unless directed by a doctor. Not for immediate relief.

406,"How It Works: Knee Pro-Tec provides compression on the patellar tendon, helping spread pressure uniformly across the patellar tendon, reducing discomfort and irritation. This compression may also help stabilize your patella, improving its tracking. In addition, Knee Pro-Tec absorbs stress to the knee, reducing vibrations in the femoral groove. Design Theory: The Knee Pro-Tec patellar tendon strap is designed to provide consistent pressure on the patellar tendon. The strap is made from neoprene, which stretches, allowing it to stay comfortably in place. Tubing, sewn into the neoprene, is used to provide gentle compression and a plastic loop is utilized to make it easier to adjust. The strap attaches with a velcro closure.

407,"The Cho-Pat Dual Action Knee Strap provides full mobility with the benefits of Dynamic Pain Diffusion – and extra dimension of relief from painful and weak knees. The Cho-Pat Dual Action Knee Strap supports you above and below the knee to provide immediate relief from Jumper’s knee and weak knees. Its exclusive range of sizes ensures a better fit and maximum performance. The Cho-Pat Dual Action Knee Strap applies pressure above and below the knee upon the patellar tendon below the kneecap to stabilize and tighten up the kneecap mechanism, which improves patellar tracking and elevation and reduces patellar subluxation. It offers pain relief and protection from knee degeneration and overuse syndromes. It adds further strengthening to the kneecap mechanism by applying pressure on the tendon above the kneecap as well which tends to reduce the forces of the quadriceps on the patella tendon and erosion of the undersurface of the kneecap due to a possible misalignment of the quadriceps (Q angle). The strap support is far superior to any single patellar strap due to providing stability without inhibiting motion. Activities can now be accomplished with the Cho-Pat Dual Action Knee Strap that otherwise could not be performed because of pain and inflammation. For maximum performance, properly measure to find the correct size. Measure around the leg at the center of the kneecap and follow the sizing chart. The purchase of this product includes 1 knee strap.

Helpful Hints:

Head Lice:  Head lice live on the scalp and lay small white eggs (nits) on the hair shaft close to the scalp.  The nits are most easily found on the nape of the neck or behind the ears.  All personal headgear, scarves, coats and bed linen should be disinfected by machine washing in hot water and drying, using the hot cycle of the dryer for at least 20 minutes.  Personal articles of clothing or bedding that cannot be washed may be  dry-cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for a period of about 2 weeks.  Personal combs and brushes may be disinfected by soaking in hot water (above 130° F) for 5 to 10 minutes.  Thorough vacuuming of rooms inhabited by infected persons is recommended.

Kills head lice, crab lice and body lice.  No harmful pesticide residue.  Safe for repeated applications.  Pleasant aroma.  Permethrin, Pyrethrum and Lindane free.

Few can resist the silken texture and elegant look of wooden kitchenware. But beauty has its price: it takes a little work to keep wood products from splitting and cracking. Snow River, which has made wood bowls and other products for 20 years, designed this food-safe mineral oil especially for kitchenware. To use it, simply wipe the wood product with a damp cloth to clean it after use, and then dry immediately. Then brush on a coat of this wood oil with a soft cloth, wiping off excess oil. For best results, repeat the oiling process after at least the first 5 to 6 times a product is used. --Leah Kohlenberg

444,"Rembrandt came to be when a dentist decided to make a better toothpaste. He began by dreaming about papayas. There's an enzyme in the papaya plant that naturally helps clean your teeth. This little enzyme, and a sprinkling of creative science, created something called Citroxain. An entirely new way of caring for your mouth was born. At Rembrandt, we believe having a healthy mouth goes beyond teeth and gums. We care about your entire mouth. It's this mouth of yours that literally tells the world who you are. With a little love and care, it can be brilliant. Deep cleans and whitens gently.







Now you can maintain a brighter, healthier smile without having to give up your favorite foods and beverages.



Q. How long does it take to see results from daily brushing with REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste?
A. It depends on the current color of your teeth. Some people see an immediate whitening effect. However, for teeth with a noticeable amount of stains, it can take longer to see a change in color. For those who already have very white teeth or have had a professional whitening service, REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste provides an excellent way to maintain the level of whiteness, especially when used in conjunction with other REMBRANDT daily whitening products.

Q. What makes REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste different/better than other whitening toothpastes on the market?
A. REMBRANDT Intense Stain Toothpaste has a unique, dual-action, proprietary formula specifically created to help lift tough stains from teeth while also helping prevent new stains from sticking to tooth enamel.



The REMBRANDT family of teeth whitening products includes five Daily Whitening products and two Fast Whitening products, as shown below, all designed to keep your teeth looking healthy and bright:

Nature Made Vitamin C 500 mg with Rose Hips may be a great option for those looking to supplement their diet and meet daily vitamin C nutrient needs.

Nature Made Vitamin C with Rose Hips is recommended for winter wellness and immunity. Vitamin Cs major role is to make collagen, an essential protein substance that holds connective tissues together in skin, bone, teeth, and other parts of the body. Vitamin C is also critical for the proper function of the immune system, for manufacturing certain nerve-transmitting substances and hormones, and for the absorption and utilization of other nutrients, such as vitamin E and iron. Vitamin C is also a very important and powerful antioxidant that works in the aqueous (water) environments of the body, such as the lungs and lens of the eye. Its primary antioxidant partners are vitamin E and the carotenes, though it also works with the antioxidant enzymes. Vitamin C regenerates oxidized vitamin E, and restores the antioxidant potential of vitamin E in the body.

460,"Do you ever feel a shortness of breath from simply walking up a flight of stairs? Would you like to gain better lung stamina during vigorous workouts? Now, thanks to the Ultrabreathe, you can relieve the symptoms of breathlessness by giving your lungs a daily workout from the comfort of the armchair. Just inhale through Ultrabreathe for a few minutes twice a day in a simple breathing pattern as shown in the instructions. Ultrabreathe works on the principle of resistance. As you inhale, the resistance created makes your respiratory muscles work harder, and the harder they work the stronger and more durable they become. As your breathing power improves, Ultrabreathe can be gradually adjusted to provide more resistance with just the twist of a knob. It can even help reduce the feeling of breathlessness from some lung diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. Doctors have been prescribing big, bulky breathing devices for post-surgery patients to increase their lung power for years. Ultrabreathe gives you the same effects, but is so small and compact you can take it with you to exercise your lungs wherever you are. Whether you¿re exercising for cardio fitness, sports or not at all, you¿ll breathe deeper and more easily than ever. Within a month you will be on your way to feeling the wonderful effects of strong, healthy lungs!

Athletes who want to boost their performance and folks who suffer from breathlessness can all benefit from using this ingenious breathing exerciser. Heres how it works: after positioning the soft mouthpiece between the teeth and gums and biting down to create an airtight seal, the user breathes in sharply and continues to breathe in hard for as long as possible. Then the breath is slowly exhaled. When repeated 25 times, twice daily, for at least a month, the exercises should noticeably increase breathing strength. As improvement occurs, the user can increase resistance by simply turning one or both parts of the device: the end cap (which holds a lightweight ball) and the valve sleeve. Measuring 5 by 2 by 1-1/4 inches, the Ultrabreathe is so compact it will fit in a pocket or travel kit for use at work, in bed, or on the road. --Ann Bieri

No matter where you're going, make every step count with the HJ-112 Pedometer. Using Omron 2D smart sensor technology, this dual-axis pedometer tracks steps accurately, whether it's in your pocket, on your belt, or clipped to your bag.

You'd be surprised by how many steps you already take each day. A few hundred walking to the bus, a couple thousand going a few blocks down for lunch, and with an Omron Pedometer, you'll know just how many steps you're taking and begin looking for ways to see that number get bigger every day.

Omron Pedometers use smart sensor technology rather than the standard pendulum system to get a more accurate reading. Many Omron Pedometers, including the HJ-112, can be programmed to your personal stride length to provide you with an even more accurate count.

Omron Dual-Axis Technology--Counts steps accurately and quietly, whether positioned vertically or horizontally.

Automatic Reset--Start with a clean slate each day to track your steps more accurately.

Weekly Log--Store up to seven days of information in memory; resets to zero at midnight, so you're ready to go every morning.

Six Tracking Modes--Track steps, aerobic steps, time, distance, calories, and fat grams burned.

Tracking for Two Kinds of Steps--The HJ-112 tracks both regular and brisk steps separately.

Walking is a great way to stay healthy. In fact, walking 10,000 steps a day is widely recommended by health and fitness professionals. And when you track your steps with a pedometer, like the Omron HJ-112, studies show you're likely to increase your total number of steps a day by about 2,000, or 1 mile.*

Warm Up First--Before your walk, stretch (arm circles, hip circles, and leg lifts) to get your blood flowing and reduce the risk of injury.

Use a Pedometer--Omron Pedometers are the partners you can count on when you want to accurately track your daily routine and help you reach your recommended 10,000 daily steps.

Set Goals--Begin slowly and work your way up. By setting goals you'll push yourself farther and achieve more.

Mix It Up--Add variety to your routine by changing pace, walking uphill, or just changing your route.

Add Resistance--Include some upper-body exercises as you walk, such as arm reaches or carrying water bottles in each hand to increase your calorie burn.

475,"General Application: Alleviates arch pain and discomfort. Medical Application: Alleviates conditions of plantar fasciitis (inflammation and tenderness of the plantar fascia). How it Works: Pro-Tec Athletics' Arch Support provides a slight lift to the arch helping to support the plantar fascia (a tough, fibrous band of tissue that runs along the sole of the foot with attachments to the heel bone and to the base of the toes). Targeted support reduces stress to the arch region and alleviates inflammation and tearing of the plantar fascia. Design Theory behind The Lift: The Arch Support achieves results similar to taping techniques by offering upward compression to the arch. This is achievable because the brace is made from stretchable material. Therefore, support is present not only when the foot is on the ground, but when the foot is elevated between steps. Soft material offers a comfortable pad for the arch when the foot does touch the ground.

488,"To get the calcium and vitamin D your body needs to support healthy bones and muscles and keep you moving, trust Caltrate, the 1 selling brand of calcium supplements in the United States. Your body needs calcium for more than just strong bones; it also plays a role in supporting your everyday activities like muscle contractions, blood clotting and nerve function. However, you need vitamin D to help calcium work for you. If you have a deficiency in vit. D, it can reduce the amount of calcium your body absorbs and can result in weakened or brittle bones, making it harder to maintain your active, healthy lifestyle. With the advanced levels of vitamin D3 in the Caltrate 600 plus D3 supplements, your body can get the help it needs to maximize calcium absorption and keep you moving throughout life. (1,3)

Caltrate contains calcium carbonate, one of the two most common forms of calcium used in dietary supplements. It is the most concentrated form of calcium, so the tablets can be smaller, allowing for easier swallowing, and you may take fewer. With fewer tablets needed in your daily routine, your bottle of Caltrate 600 plus vitamin D3 may last longer compared to other supplement forms, which contain calcium citrate. Backed by over 25 years of nutritional science research, Caltrate is formulated with consideration given to recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences to support bone and overall health.

(2) Per tablet; among leading calcium supplement brands.

(3) IRI retail sales data supports that Caltrate is the 1 selling calcium supplement brand in the US.

Caltrate 600+D contains 600 mg calcium plus 200 IU of vitamin D per tablet. Vitamin D aids in the absorption of calcium. Aging decreases the capacity to produce vitamin D, so adults over the age of 65 are particularly susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. You may also be at risk if you do not consume dairy products, since most consumption of vitamin D comes from fortified milk and cereal products.

518,"There are many techniques used to remove unsightly body hair. Many cultures used many methods to remove body hair in all or certain areas. The various methods fell under the grouping of epilation. Electrolysis has been the leading approach for over 100 years in western civilization. The first person to use electrolysis for hair removal was Dr. Charles E. Michel (1833 - 1913), a St. Louis, Missouri ophthalmologist (eye doctor) who, in 1875, reported the results of his use of electrolysis in trichiasis (ingrown eyelashes) (St. Louis Clinical Record, October, 1875, 2:145-148). He had been performing electrolysis since 1869.

Clean and Easy Home Electrolysis Deluxe takes electrolysis out of the therapist's office and into your home. It's a convenient, safe alternative toward achieving a great appearance.

Hair growth is the result of heredity and hormonal levels. Also, some drugs, temporary methods of hair removal, and some illnesses can stimulate hair growth. Usually, hair growth is desirable. But when the hair is the wrong part of your body -- a woman's upper lip or chin or bikini line, for example -- you may be considering electrolysis.

Many need to go to licensed electrolysis practitioner, which can be quite expensive. The Clean and Easy Home Electrolysis Deluxe Kit is an economical alternative in the privacy of your own domain.

Electrolysis is a way of removing individual hairs from the face or body. Today's medical electrolysis devices destroy the growth center of the hair with chemical or heat energy. A very fine probe is inserted into the hair follicle at the surface of the skin. The hair is then removed with tweezers.

As we enter our 48th year, we have renewed our commitment to being a leader in the natural skin care industry, and we will continue to keep Stephen and Judy’s vision growing by creating unsurpassed natural skin care he would be proud of – and that our customers love.

The SureGrip magnifiers are all ergonomically designed with rubberized handles with built-in finger grooves to rest comfortably in the palm of your hand. Each of these magnifying lenses are securely held in place and protected by a full, heavy duty plastic rim. The SureGrip Series magnifiers are available in four different styles. The SG-10 (3.5 inch) and the SG-16 (3.3 inch x 2.0 inch) both contain glass lenses while the lenses on the SG-12 (4.3 inch lens) and SG-14 (5.0 inch lens) contain acrylic lenses. While the acrylic styles are larger and lighter in weight, the glass lenses are less prone to scratching and allow for a slightly higher light transmission for sharper, clearer images. Glass lenses also tend to magnify a little bit more due to the density of the glass. However, the acrylic styles will cover a wider field of view and are easier to navigate with due to the lighter weight of the lens. The SG-16 style is a little more unique in that it has a rectangular shaped lens which makes it easier on the eyes for reading. The SG-16 also contains fold out, sturdy legs that allows the magnifier to stand up on its own for hand-held or hands-free usage. A soft padded, zippered case is included with every magnifier to protect the lenses from scratching and dust. The SureGrip Series magnifiers are perfect for everything from reading, crafts, hobbies, inspection and so much more! At Carson, we strive to make sure our customers are 100% satisfied with the quality of our magnifiers. We are so confident in our magnifiers that we back them with a Lifetime Limited Warranty! Carson will repair or replace your magnifier if it is found to have manufacturing defects in materials or workmanship. Please contact Carson for additional warranty details.

Goldenseal Root (Hydrastis Canadensis), grows in the wild in the eastern United States and southern Canada. The plant is a low growing, sprawling leafy plant found in rich shady soil in forested areas. It is in the Ranunculaceae , or buttercup family. The part of the plant most often used as a remedy is the underground rhizome. This root has a deep yellow color, which probably lead to the names “yellow root’ and ‘orange root’. It is high in berberine- a bright yellow very bitter alkaloid, which, along with other alkaloids, including canadine and hydrastine, gives goldenseal its distinctive color, along with many of its helpful properties.* Native people used goldenseal for centuries for a variety of health challenges, including those linked to micro-organisms as a causative factor. * It supports the health and resistance of mucous membranes * that line the digestive, respiratory and urinary tract to help act as a protective shield. *

StimuCal is rich in native type I collagen­—the predominant protein found in bone—and has been clinically demonstrated not to disproportionately spike calcium blood levels as do other forms of calcium, such as the carbonate and citrate salt forms.* StimuCal is combined with vitamin D3 and vitamin K2 (as MK-7 from natural fermentation [a more bioavailable form of vitamin K]) to support the proper deposition of calcium into the bone matrix, thereby maintaining skeletal integrity, as well as supporting cardiovascular and arterial health.* Potassium citrate is a systemic alkalizer added for optimal osteo support.* HEALTH CLAIM: Adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life. For best results, use with Jarrow Formulas JarroSil, the biologically Activated Silicon



Jarrow Formulas Bone-Up provides comprehensive supplemental nutritional support for maintaining strong, healthy bones.* Bone-Up has been a featured product of Jarrow Formulas for some time and has been updated through the years to reflect the latest scientific findings regarding skeletal health.

Promotes bone density with comprehensive supplemental nutrition.

Provides the essentials for proper calcium utilization by the body. View larger.

In 1982, an important calcium supplementation study was concluded and reported by the Dept. of Medicine and Radiology, Royal Free Hospital in London, England. Fifty-three women with reduced calcium absorption and accelerated bone loss were separated into three groups and studied for over 14 months. At the conclusion of the study, only the women that received 1,000 mg of calcium from ossein hydroxyapatite (OHC) along with vitamin D showed significant support for bone-health.*

OHC produces more prolonged calcium balance than soluble calcium salts. It also allows the bone osteoblast cells to be more receptive to its components and to build bone tissue. Furthermore, OHC provides both the organic and inorganic constituents found in human bone: the hydroxyapatite microcrystals consist of calcium, phosphorous, oxygen, and hydrogen; the trace minerals zinc, strontium, silicon and iron; and proteins, amino acids and aminoglycans.*

Bone consists of calcium and phosphorous crystals embedded in a framework of interlocking protein fibers. The protein fibers are made primarily of collagen. The mineral crystals give bone hardness, strength, and rigidity. Collagen fibers impart their quality of flexibility. Hydroxyapatite composes 67 percent of the weight of bone, and the collagenous fibers make up the remaining 33 percent.*

The average adult has 1,000 - 1,200 grams of calcium in the body. Bones are the body's largest calcium storehouse and will release calcium into the bloodstream in order to ensure correct blood levels of calcium. Thus, blood calcium levels can be normal while bone loss can be considerable.

Between 2 - 4 percent of a person's skeleton is remodeled every year. This means that calcium and other minerals leave the bone in a process called resorption and then must be ""remodeled"" or replaced. Whether due to poor nutrition or reduced hormone levels with the onset of aging, the loss of calcium and other minerals from the bone creates tiny holes that make bones weak and brittle, particularly if collagen is being lost.

It has been estimated that post-menopausal women lose 0.7 percent to 2 percent of their bone per year while men lose 0.5 percent-0.7 percent. Between 45 and 75 years of age, women lose 30 percent of their skeletal structure and men lose 15 percent.

It starts with the finest source of calcium available: New Zealand or Australian bovine bone hydroxyapatite from chemical-free, range-grazed calves less than two years old (bones from veal calves are never used). Skeletal health, however, requires more than calcium. Scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates the need for other nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin K, potassium, magnesium, boron, and trace minerals such as zinc, copper, and manganese.*

Research has indicated that 85 percent of women over the age of 20 and at least 50 percent of men from age 35 consume less than the RDI for calcium. Caffeine, alcohol, sugar, high protein diets and soda (particularly sodas that are high in phosphorous) can deplete calcium.

In addition, calcium absorption has long been thought to be stomach-acid dependent, but both stomach acid production and calcium absorption decline with age.

The results of a clinical trial published in the Journal of Nutritional & Environmental Medicine (DiSilvestro RA et al. J Nutr Environ Med. 2007; 16(1):26-32) found that exercise and supplementation of calcium, vitamin D3 and other micronutrients from Bone-Up significantly improved bone health in young adult women.*

In an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of 24 female students ages 18 to 24, supplementation with Bone-Up (not placebo) was found to produce statistically significant decreases in markers of bone degradation, while increasing levels of plasma bone specific alkaline phosphatase (an indicator of bone synthesis), plasma 2,5-OH-vitamin D (an indicator of vitamin D nutritional status) and plasma parathyroid hormone.*

Health Claim: In conjunction with regular, weight-bearing exercise and a healthy diet, calcium helps teen and young adult women build bone mass and maintain bone health, and may reduce their risk of osteoporosis later in life.* Daily calcium intake above 2,000 mg is not likely to provide additional benefit. Adequate calcium intake is also linked to reduced osteoporosis by slowing bone loss in older men and women.*

Unlike most commercial antiperspirant/deodorant products, which contain aluminum to clog pores in order to eliminate sweating, you won't find any harsh chemicals or aluminum in Lavilin's Foot Deodorant Cream. Instead, it utilizes a proprietary combination of natural herbs to help address odor and attacks odor-causing bacteria without interfering with the body's natural ability to remove toxins/sweat. Furthermore, wear and tear on leather shoes, caused primarily by intense perspiration odor, is considerably reduced, as is the unpleasant odor commonly associated with sports shoes.

Although a nonessential amino acid, L-glutamine has become the focus of extensive scientific interest because of its important physiological role. Since the 1980s, many researchers have come to regard glutamine as “conditionally essential. ” Conditionally essential nutrients are those which the body can produce in quantities sufficient to maintain health under normal circumstances, but for which the body’s needs outstrip synthesis under various conditions. In the case of glutamine, food restriction and other forms of physical and/or mental stress can cause the body to require more glutamine than will be available without supplementation. Under non-stressful conditions, adequate glutamine is synthesized primarily from glutamic acid, valine, and isoleucine. However, stress can decrease glutamine levels in the blood by as much as 30% and the levels in the muscles by as much as 50%.

Glutamine is important for muscle regeneration because it is an important precursor of nucleic acids, nucleotides, amino sugars, and proteins particularly by virtue of its ability to transport nitrogen between tissues. For this reason, glutamine is often used for enhancing exercise performance and supporting post-workout recovery.* Glutamine is used not only in the muscles, but also in the metabolism of the immune system, the intestinal tract, the kidneys, gallbladder, pancreas, and liver. Among amino acids, glutamine uniquely serves as a preferred energy source for rapidly dividing cells, such as those of the intestinal wall and the lymphatic system. As a result, glutamine is often recommended to support immune and gastrointestinal health.*

Glutamine also acts as a regulator of the body’s acid-base balance – that is, it helps to maintain the proper pH of the system – through the buffering of ammonia. Glutamic acid reacts with ammonia when it is present in high concentrations producing glutamine. Glutamine also readily passes across the blood-brain barrier, where it serves as a precursor for both the stimulating neurotransmitter, glutamic acid, and the calming agent, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Glutamic acid does not cross the blood/-brain barrier. This could be why glutamine has been used to support and stabilize mood, especially by dieters.*

L-Glutamine - the most abundant amino acid in the human body - is involved in many metabolic processes, including the synthesis and protection of muscle tissue, the production of glycogen, and immune support during periods of immune and muscular stress.* L-Glutamine is also a major source of fuel for enterocytes (intestinal cells) and hence supports the integrity of the intestinal lining.*

A series of dose-response studies was conducted to evaluate the clinical safety, pharmacokinetics, and metabolic effects of L-glutamine administered to humans. Initial studies in normal individuals evaluated the short-term response to oral loads of glutamine at doses of 0, 0.1, and 0.3 g/kg. A dose-related increase in blood glutamine occurred after oral loading and elevation of amino acids known to be end products of glutamine metabolism occurred (including alanine, citrulline, and arginine). No evidence of clinical toxicity or generation of toxic metabolites (ammonia and glutamate) was observed.* Glutamine has been shown to be safe in oral doses up to 40 grams per day. Significant side effects have not been reported in clinical studies. However, mania has been reported in some individuals with bipolar disorder so should be avoided if bipolar disorder has been diagnosed or is suspected.

Ever since Anna and Melville Bissell patented the sweeper in 1876, it’s been the standard for easy cleanup. Whether power or manual, our sweepers work on a variety of surfaces—including hard floors, area rugs, and carpet—so they’re ideal for everyday use. Throw out your broom and dustpan and bring home an easier clean.

From invention to innovation, our manual sweepers pick up lint, crumbs, and dirt using no electricity or disposable pads. It’s an easy way to keep floors dirt free everyday.

Sweepers provide a simple and inexpensive way to keep carpet, area rugs and hard floors picked up in between cleanings. Your home will have the “in-between clean” – meaning it will stay in order even when you don’t have time to do a routine vacuuming. Since sweepers don’t have any suction, they are great for cleaning rugs that might otherwise get sucked up in the vacuum.

We know space can sometimes be at a minimum so we’ve designed powerful floor cleaners that are compact and easy-to-store. Plus, many of our products have narrower cleaning paths making it easier to maneuver around furniture and in small spaces.

A big-time clean doesn’t always mean a big-time size. At BISSELL, we’ve designed several lightweight options to bring you the great cleaning you need in an easy-to-carry design.



An ideal tool for dry pickups and quick cleaning, the Bissell Swift Sweep carpet sweeper is quiet, motorless, and multifunctional. Use it on bare floors or carpets to sweep up dirt and crumbs, and slide it under furniture to trap lint and dust bunnies. The sweeper's dual-direction brush roll snags debris off the floor in both forward and reverse, so coverage is highly efficient. The twin dustpans empty easily with a simple push from underneath, and a clip-on comb helps keep the brush roll clean. Made of durable steel with a thick rubber bumper, the sweeper is long lasting and kind to floors and furniture. The construction is straightforward, easy to use, and lightweight in action. Standing 43-1/4 inches high, the sweeper measures 10-1/2 by 9-1/2 inches at the base and carries a one-year warranty. --Emily Bedard

*First four blades vs. Fusion.
**vs. Fusion® Manual.



How long will the Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge last?
How long a razor cartridge lasts varies from person to person, as it is dependent on many variables such as beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits, and skin sensitivity. The Gillette Mach3 Power Cartridges have an lubricating strip which will provide you with a visual cue — it fades to white — when shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to consider changing the blade on your razor.

Will the Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge fit any other razors on the market?
The Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge features a razor blade that fits on any Gillette Mach3 Power, Mach3 Turbo, or Mach3 handle. All Mach cartridges can fit on all Mach handles.

Is it better to use hot, cold, or warm water to shave?
Warm water is best for hydrating beard hair. Soaking in warm water softens hair and causes it to expand, making it 70% easier to cut.

What is the best way to avoid razor burn?
If the skin is not properly prepared before shaving or if the blade on your razor is dull, you are more likely to end up with razor burn. Make sure to hydrate hair in warm water for up to three minutes and apply plenty of shave gel. Also, consider changing the blade on your razor at the first sign of dullness or discomfort.

Is it okay to let my girlfriend or wife borrow my men’s razor?
For both hygiene and performance, it's not a good idea to share your razor with your partner. Women have a much larger area to shave and you may find that after only a few shaves, your blade has dulled considerably; increasing the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Tell her to try a razor specifically designed for the way a woman shaves, such as Gillette Venus® Embrace®.

Does shaving make your hair grow back thicker?
Scientists at Gillette have conducted extensive testing on the effects shaving has on both male and female hair growth, texture, and color. This testing has proven that shaving does not affect hair growth, color, or texture. Shaving does, however, alter the tip shape of the regrown hair, which may initially change the way hair feels as it grows back. But if hair is left to regrow completely, it will return to its former state.

In what direction should I shave to achieve Gillette’s best shave?
Men’s facial hair tends to grow in different directions. Start by shaving with light, gentle strokes with the grain. Then, if necessary, go against the grain for a close shave.

What is the difference between disposable and refillable razors?
The entire razor is discarded when you are through with a disposable razor. With a refillable razor, only the blade cartridge is replaced. Refillable razors like Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Fusion incorporate more advanced blade technology and ergonomics vs. most disposables for great control and a close comfortable shave.

What are the differences between single, double, triple and 5-blade razors? Which is best?
Gillette's research has demonstrated that single blade technology, which has been applied since 1901, is demonstrably inferior to twin blade shaving systems such as Sensor Excel®, and even more so to 5-blade systems such as Gillette Fusion ProGlide. But the number of blades alone does not ensure a superior shave. The 5-blade shaving surface of Fusion ProGlide Manual and Fusion ProGlide Power features progressive blade alignment, an advanced blade coating process and a flexible comfort guard, which collectively provide Gillette's most comfortable shave.

How do I avoid nicks and cuts, particularly above my upper lip?
The area above the upper lip is tricky for many men. To help avoid nicks and cuts, always leave it for last. Apply plenty of shave gel and allow this area to soak up as much lather as possible. When shaving, don't apply too much pressure.

Saliva is the ideal choice of specimen to measure hormone levels. Saliva measures the ""Unbound Biologically Active"", or free hormone levels in the body. When blood is filtered through salivary glands the bound hormone components are too large to pass through cell membranes of the salivary glands. Only the unbound hormones pass through in the saliva. What is measured in saliva is considered the ""free bio-available hormone,” and is indicative of hormone levels that will be delivered to the receptors in the tissue of the body.

In every moment of every day, the cells in your body are engaged in over one million different metabolic reactions. Health is the reflection of how efficiently these reactions occur.

Nutrition is important because it provides the raw materials and energy that power cellular function. Multiple vitamin and mineral supplements exist to provide the nutrients your body needs but might not get enough of from food.

All foods contain vitamins and minerals, although not in the amounts that progressive nutritionists consider optimal. But, they also contain trace elements, antioxidants, digestive enzymes, co-nutrients, and, most importantly, phytochemicals.

Phytochemicals are factors that plants produce to protect themselves from bacteria, yeasts, molds, fungi, viruses, UV radiation, etc. When we eat plant based foods, this protection is passed on to us. This is why doctors and nutritionists suggesting eating at least seven servings of different fruits and vegetables each day.

Very few Americans get these levels of fruits and vegetables. But, even those who do don’t get the most effective phytochemicals. These exist only in a very select group of plants called Superior Herbs. These plants were the world’s first dietary supplements, and have been used to build immediate energy and long term health in every holistic medical system that ever existed.

Put simply, Life Essence is the world’s most complete multivitamin. It begins with perfectly balanced vitamins and minerals, but also contains trace elements, antioxidants, enzymes, co-nutrients and phytochemicals needed for the most complete cellular support possible. With over 40,000 mg of raw, whole food value, it is also amazingly energizing.

Over time undigested food and waste can build up in the intestinal tract and colon, which can be a perfect breeding ground for harmful bacteria. Mag O7 Oxygen Cleanse supplement capsules works to break down and remove old debris and target the harmful bacteria, while magnesium works to soften the intestinal build up and remove unwanted waste.

Mag 07 is a combination of magnesium oxide compounds which have been ozonated and stabilized to release singlet oxygen over 12 hours or more. Stabilized oxygen is a non-technical term referring to a compound containing oxygen atoms which are stabilized with buffers so that the product can be bottled without the oxygen being released before it is needed. The result is a stable environment of oxygen which can be taken as a dietary supplement. The timed release ensures that Mag 07 will provide an adequate amount of oxygen, slowly, for better utilization. The release of oxygen continues throughout the digestive system. The magnesium acts as a vehicle to transport the oxygen throughout the body and has a gentle stool softening effect. Mag O7 is unlike any other colon cleanser on the market, as Mag O7 actually releases oxygen. Mag O7 helps cleanse the intestinal tract and colon by breaking down and loosening the unwanted fecal matter where it can be excreted by the body. The magnesium transports the oxygen throughout the intestinal tract, kidneys and bladder helping to cleanse by delivering oxygen along the way. Mag O7 can be used as a stool softener, Mag O7 serves as an alternative choice for consumers needing this benefit. Other benefits of MagO7 include full digestive cleanse, body detoxification, relief of occasional constipation, oxygen support, and creating a healthy probiotic environment.

1119,"Kombu is a sea vegetables of the 'Laminaria' family of which there are more than ten species. EDEN Kombu (Laminaria japonica) is a dark greenish brown sea vegetable with thick, wide leafy fronds that grow in the waters off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan's northern most island. This type of kombu, known as 'Ma-konbu', is prized not only for its abundance of essential minerals, vitamins, and trace elements but also for its natural glutamic salts that make it an excellent flavoring agent. Kombu contains the amino acid glutamine, a naturally sweet, superior flavor enhancer.EDEN Kombu Sea Vegetable grows wild in the clean, cold northern waters where the choicest grades of kombu grow bathed in steady Arctic currents. Eden selects only the tender central part of the plant that has the best flavor and texture. The fronds are hand harvested using long poles with knives attached to cut the kombu free from the ocean bottom. As the kombu floats to the surface it is gathered into boats and taken ashore. The fronds are washed, folded and naturally sun dried on the white sand beaches before cutting and packaging. Lesser grades of commercial kombu are cultivated artificially or simply gathered from the beach after washing ashore. Many are sprayed with chemically produced and toxic monosodium glutamate (MSG) to make the kombu more tender. EDEN Kombu grows wild and is gathered by hand from the sea while the plant is still living.As with all sea vegetables, kombu was traditionally valued for its ability to cleanse the blood and help the body eliminate toxins. Kombu is a source of essential minerals, vitamins and important trace elements, including calcium, iron, iodine, vitamins A, B1, B2, C, B6 and niacin. Kombu is high in alginic acid, a polysaccharide similar to pectin found in the cellulose of land plants.

While these ear plugs achieved noise reduction ratings as high as 32 decibels, the dense foam could be challenging to roll for proper insertion as well as fit and the coarse surface of the ear plugs could feel rather abrasive against the thin inner lining of the ear canal.

1224,"The new Activator shaving system easily removes any hair type on your face, even in problem zones. The revolutionary foil has a new geometry with different shaped holes. This combined with the shaver head, which moves in 4 directions, ensures that any individual hair growth pattern is captured effortlessly in few strokes. The unique Clean&Charge system automatically selects the best out of three cleaning programs based upon how much cleaning your shaver needs. It automatically recharges the battery at the same time, leaving yourshaver always fully powered and thoroughly cleaned.

Get ready for a shaving breakthrough. With the Activator self-cleaning shaving system, Braun brings cutting edge technology to the modern face. At the heart of the system is a revolutionary new ""Smart Foil."" This unique material has differently shaped holes that capture hair growing in any direction for a closer shave in fewer strokes-- even in problem areas like the neck. The other key feature of the system is called ""Clean and Renew,"" an automated cleaning technology that keeps the Activator feeling like a new shaver every time you use it.

All in the Head
The Activator's unique head boasts a number of clever innovations, not the least of which is the smart foil. The foil is made up of differently shaped holes which, in combination with other Activator technologies, effortlessly shaves any hair type in fewer strokes. The holes within the foil vary in direction, size and shape-- much like the hair on the face. This variation allows more hairs to be captured on each stroke. The smart foil provides no less than 20 different hair-capturing opportunities compared to ordinary shaver foils that only provide one.

What's more, the shaver head also oscillates from side to side. These micro-oscillations enable the shaver foils to capture even more hair, and provide smoother gliding for maximum skin comfort, even in sensitive areas like the neck. Meanwhile, the Activator's shaving head adjusts automatically to facial contours, ensuring the shaver foils are always in optimal contact with the skin. This contour-hugging action can be switched off for facial areas where manual control is preferred. A three-stage cutting system is integrated into the head that works to deliver smoother, faster shaving results. First, the top foil shaves short hairs and stubble. Next, the Activator's high-performance middle trimmer effortlessly cuts longer hairs, before the second foil completes the shave for an exceptional finish.

Clean Living
The Activator's clean and renew system keeps it feeling like a new shaver. There are three different cleaning programs available, one of which is automatically selected based on how often the shaver is used and how much cleaning it needs. During the automatic cleaning program, a fresh alcohol-based cleaning fluid is pumped through the shaver head, so it quickly and hygienically cleans away shaved stubble. During the intensive cleaning cycle the cleaning solution is heated, so even the most stubborn debris and grease is removed from the shaver head. The alcohol-based cleaning solution is specially formulated for optimal hygiene. As an added bonus, the cleaning formula also lubricates the cutting elements for optimal cutting efficiency.

Once cleaning is finished, the shaver is silently dried using an inductive heating system. This thoroughly dries the shaver head to extend durability and maximize the shaver's performance. After drying, the shaver is automatically charged leaving it fully powered and ready to deliver peak performance at all times. Washed away stubble is retained in the cleaning cartridge, which can easily be disposed off with regular household garbage. There are no filters to replace and no cleaning of the unit required. Everything is neatly contained within the cartridge.

Brain Power
The Activator uses a special control chip to optimize battery life. This ""Smart Logic"" system is activated every time the shaver is charged, and maintains the battery at its peak. The new chip monitors the battery performance and services the battery when needed by discharging and recharging it automatically. This means the Activator is always ready for ultimate shaver performance whenever you need it.

Fully charged, the shaver offers up to 50 minutes (2-3 weeks) of cordless shaving. The batteries fully recharge in one hour, and there's a quick charge mode that gives you enough juice for one shave after a three minute charge. The Activator uses Ni-MH batteries and features automatic worldwide voltage adjustment. If you desire, cord power can also be used with the Activator.

Short Description/What is it? Parissa Chamomile Body Sugar is a sugar based wax that is gentle on sensitive skin. Best for waxing fine to medium hair types.

What does it do? Parissa Chamomile Body Sugar is a natural wax that’s gentle on skin. Waxing provides long term results by removing hair from the root and discouraging re-growth. This means your skin stays smooth for weeks longer than shaving. Each time you wax, the hair follicle is weakened, over time hair regrowth becomes softer and sparser

Who is it for? Parissa Chamomile Body Sugar is made from four simple ingredients: Sugar, water, chamomile extract and citric acid. It’s the best choice for those concerned about skin sensitivity as it’s very gentle. This wax is best for those with fine to medium hair types.

How do I use it? Gently warm Parissa Chamomile Body Sugar in the microwave or on a Parissa Wax Warmer. Apply a paper thin layer in the direction of hair growth. Press on fabric strips and zip away. Clean-up or remove any excess wax with warm water. Your kit includes detailed photo instructions, please read them as technique is key. But don’t be shy get in touch if you have questions! We’re here to help.

How do I clean it? Sugar waxes are also known as washable waxes because they are easy to clean. All you need is warm water.

Parissa Expert Waxing Tips

All Parissa Washable Waxes: Previously shaved hair is stubbly & resistant. Wait for 2 weeks hair growth (½ cm or ¼”) before waxing. Wash and dry skin thoroughly before waxing.

Chamomile body sugar: Warm the wax gently (20 seconds in microwave) to achieve a liquid honey consistency. Apply a paper thin layer of wax, in the direction of hair growth. The thinner the better. Press on a fabric strip, zip away in the opposite direction of hair growth. Speed is key for the best results. Always remove strips quickly and in one motion. Never pull straight up, pull backwards and stay close and in parallel to the skin. Keep the skin taut while removing the strip, this avoids movement of the skin and helps reduce discomfort.

Why we love it: Parissa Chamomile Body Sugar is gentle on sensitive skin and it’s easy to clean away excess wax or spills with water.

1262,"Why clean your tongue clinical studies have confirmed that odor-causing bacteria on the tongue is the primary cause of bad breath and a potential contributor to other oral health problems such as periodontal disease. Especially during sleep, the tongue accumulates a plaque film of bacteria and other odor causing compounds. The texture of the tongue is very conducive to housing this unwanted material. This is why fresh breath is difficult to maintain, even after brushing your teeth. Brushing your tongue with a toothbrush only stirs up this plaque film, it doesn't effectively remove it. Benefits the Tongue Cleaner is scientifically designed to effectively clean the tongue, especially the important hard to clean rear dorsal portion of the tongue that is very susceptible to the accumulation of plaque during sleep. This effective cleaning removes the cause of the bad breath problem rather than simply treating the symptoms with mouthwash and breath aids. Effectively cleaning the tongue is as important as flossing and brushing your teeth to maintain fresh breath and a clean healthy mouth and gums. The Tongue Cleaner is the impressive addition to your daily oral care regimen. You remove the prime cause of bad breath, restore your taste sensation and improve your oral hygiene. Enjoy a clean, fresh, healthy mouth. You'll be amazed at how quick and easy the Tongue Cleaner is to use. Once you have used it for a few days, you won't be without it.

The 3M E-A-R Classic Ear Plugs OCS1137 are constructed from slow-recovery, low-pressure foam. They fit snugly to create a noise barrier that helps protect hearing from loud sounds. These ear plugs are stiff enough when compressed to make fitting easy, yet soft enough to be comfortable in the ear for extended wear. Bright yellow color allows supervisors to conduct quick visual hearing protection compliance checks. Recommended applications include chipping, chiseling, drilling, furnace operations, grinding, heavy equipment operations, machining, pouring/casting, power fastening, riveting, sanding, sawing and welding. These earplugs are commonly used in the following industries: agriculture, automotive, chemicals, construction, general manufacturing, healthcare, oil and gas, and pharmaceuticals. These regular size earplugs comfortably fit most people. These ear plugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 29 dB, CSA Class AL. These earplugs can be fit tested with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System. Moisture resistance helps maintain a consistent fit, even when humidity is present. Not only is noise present in our daily routines, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by consistent use of hearing protection. Note: 3M strongly recommends fit testing of hearing protectors. Research suggests that many users will receive less noise reduction than indicated by the NRR due to variation in hearing protector fit, fitting skill, and motivation of the user. If the NRR is used, 3M recommends that it be reduced by 50% or in accordance with applicable regulations. Disclaimer: 3M industrial and occupational products are intended, labeled, and packaged for sale to trained industrial and occupational customers for workplace use.

These earplugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 29 dB, CSA Class AL. These earplugs are test compatible with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System. Moisture resistance helps maintain a consistent expansion time, even when humidity is present. Flame resistance helps protect against potential arc flash situations and provides for safer storage.

Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by judicious use of hearing protection. To find out which hearing protection products are best for you, try different devices from the wide variety available today. Be sure to carefully read the instructions — hearing protection must fit properly and be worn correctly to do the job.

Hearing protector effectiveness is specified by a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR), typically ranging from 15 to 35 decibels. In practice, the protection that normally can be achieved is about 10 to 20 decibels. The more carefully you fit and wear hearing protectors, the higher your protection will be.

Doing it right means doing it safely. That means choosing the right safety products before the project begins. With a full portfolio of personal protection and home safety products, 3M Safety Products are designed to help keep DIYers and professionals protected in and around the home. We strive to give consumers the confidence in knowing they are prepared with reliable products from a trusted brand, so they can stay focused on the task at hand, not on their safety products.

Nutrition for sustained energy. Clif Bar supports organizations that address environmental, health and social issues. Clif Bar is named after my father, Clifford, my childhood hero and companion throughout the Sierra Nevada mountains. In 1990, I lived in a garage with my dog, skis, climbing gear, bicycle and two trumpets. The inspiration to create an energy bar occurred during a day-long, 175-mile ride with my buddy, Jay. We'd been gnawing on some other energy bars. Suddenly, despite my hunger, I couldn't take another bite. That's the moment I now call the epiphany. Two years later, after countless hours in Mom's kitchen, Clif Bar became a reality. And the mission to create a better-tasting energy bar was accomplished. Thanks, Mom! Clif Bar has grown since 1990, and still the spirit of adventure that began on that ride continues to thrive each day. As the company evolves, we face many choices, yet we always do our best to take care of our people, our community and our environment. - Gary, owner of Clif Bar.

Causes of low blood oxygen levels include blocked airways, high altitudes, anemia, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome and sleep apnea, according to the Mayo Clinic. Other pulmonary conditions such as pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary fibrosis also can cause low oxygen levels. Even the normal aging process seems to lead to low oxygen levels in some people. Many have found that a little extra oxygen gives them what they need to improve their health. As you know, oxygen is vital to your body. The trillions of cells in your body need a continuous supply of oxygen to carry out their many vital functions. We can survive for days without water, weeks without food, but only a few minutes without oxygen.

1444,"More than 40 years ago this simple hearing protector, the world’s first foam ear plug, revolutionized hearing protection in the workplace and has remained to this day one of the most widely used earplugs in the world. The 3M E-A-R Classic Ear Plugs are constructed from slow-recovery, low-pressure foam. They fit snugly to create a noise barrier that helps protect hearing from loud sounds. These ear plugs are stiff enough when compressed to make fitting easy, yet soft enough to be comfortable in the ear for extended wear. Bright yellow color allows supervisors to conduct quick visual hearing protection compliance checks. Recommended applications include chipping, chiseling, drilling, furnace operations, grinding, heavy equipment operations, machining, pouring/casting, power fastening, riveting, sanding, sawing and welding. These earplugs are commonly used in the following industries: agriculture, automotive, chemicals, construction, general manufacturing, healthcare, oil and gas, and pharmaceuticals. These ear plugs have a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 29 dB, CSA Class AL.* Can be fit tested with the 3M E-A-Rfit Validation System. Moisture resistance helps maintain a consistent fit, even when humidity is present. Not only is noise present in our daily routines, but millions of Americans work in hazardous noise on a daily basis. Estimates from the National Institutes of Health suggest that approximately 15 percent of Americans (26 million people) between the ages of 20 and 69 have high frequency hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work or during leisure activities. Hearing loss due to noise is almost entirely preventable by consistent use of hearing protection.* Note: 3M strongly recommends fit testing of hearing protectors. Research suggests that many users will receive less noise reduction than indicated by the NRR due to variation in hearing protector fit, fitting skill, and motivation of the user. If the NRR is used, 3M recommends that it be reduced by 50% or in accordance with applicable regulations. Disclaimer: 3M industrial and occupational products are intended, labeled, and packaged for sale to trained industrial and occupational customers for workplace use.

The Bongers provide an invigorating percussion- like massage called tapotement which improves circulation, eases muscle tension, and reduces the appearance of cellulite. They're good for breaking down muscle tension and stimulating circulation. Most people store tension in their neck and shoulders, and that's usually where bongers are most effective. However, they feel good all over giving an invigorating, Shiatsu-like massage. Their flexible shafts do all the work, allowing the bongers to work indefinitely.

1588,"Don’t let poison oak or ivy ruin your outdoor plans! Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy and Oak Scrub is the first step in your poison oak or ivy treatment regimen. Use before or after the rash has appeared. Our special skin cleanser works by washing away urushiol, the toxic resin found in poisonous plants, allowing the skin to begin its natural healing process. Tecnu Extreme is an excellent first choice before a cortisone or hydrocortisone treatment. If the rash has already begun, we recommend using Tecnu Extreme as an all-over body application. Apply product to wet skin. Then gently scrub the affected areas to remove the rash-causing poison ivy oil from your skin. Complete your treatment regimen by following up with an anti-itch and pain relieving gel or spray. Be proactive next time. Tecnu Extreme can also be used before a rash begins. After coming in contact with poisonous plants, apply Tecnu Extreme to exposed areas of skin. If you’re hypersensitive, do an all- over application, since the rash-causing oils are invisible and can spread to other parts of the body. Tecnu products are designed for those who love the outdoors, adventure and exploring. Our product collection includes the Tecnu Original Outdoor Cleanser, Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy and Oak Scrub, Tecnu Rash Relief Spray and Calagel Anti-Itch Gel. Tecnu products allow you to wander confidently, knowing you have powerful protection and fast-acting itch relief at your fingertips. Tecnu Extreme does not contain plastic microbeads. The exfoliating ingredient in Tecnu Extreme is silicon dioxide (SiO2), also known as silica. It is a natural compound made of two of the earth’s most abundant materials: silicon (Si) and oxygen (O2). Silicon dioxide is most often recognized in the form of quartz, and It’s found naturally in water, plants, animals, and the earth.

Anyone who is serious about improving his or her total health and fitness will love InnerScanTM. The monitors use Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA) to monitor multiple components of overall health. The results are analyzed along with gender, age, height and weight for the most accurate and comprehensive at-home reading ever available.

The Tanita BC533 Glass Innerscan Body Composition Monitor is one of the most comprehensive body monitors on the market today that's designed for home use. Using advanced Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA) technology that was previously available only to medical professionals, health clubs and professional athletes,

With the Tanita BC533 up to four unique users can benefit. Simply supply your gender, age, height and weight into the memory, step on the scale, and the monitor does the rest. The results are analyzed according to each user's information, and the result -- displayed in the monitor's 2.25-inch LCD screen -- is the one of the most comprehensive at-home readings you can get.

This monitor, which is about the same size as a typical bathroom scale, is ideal for anyone who is serious about monitoring their health and fitness. Knowing your body fat percentage -- the amount of body fat as a proportion of your body weight -- is essential if you want to create a diet and exercise plan that helps reduce the risk of certain conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Body water percentage is the total amount of fluid in your body expressed as a percentage of your total weight. Maintaining a healthy body water percentage ensures that your body functions efficiently. The metabolic age level is related to your body's metabolic rate and helps you maintain the daily minimum level of energy or calories your body requires when resting or sleeping to function effectively. Even though your total body weight might not change drastically over time, your muscle mass and body fat levels may be changing. Keeping tabs on them can help you stay at a lower risk of certain diseases. And knowing your levels of visceral fat -- the fat in the abdominal cavity and surrounding the vital organs -- can help you keep heart disease and high blood pressure at bay, and may delay the onset of type two diabetes. In short, this monitor gives you essential information and greater control as you work to stay healthy and live a more active, vital life.

Operating on four AA batteries (included), the Tanita BC533 is intended for use by persons up to 330 pounds and is backed by Tanita's 3-year warranty.

Note: Pregnant women should not use this monitor, and if you have a pacemaker or other internal electronic medical device, you should not use the body fat reading feature.

Knowing your body fat percentage -- the amount of body fat as a proportion of your body weight -- is essential if you want to create a diet and exercise plan that helps reduce the risk of certain conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Body water percentage is the total amount of fluid in your body expressed as a percentage of your total weight. Maintaining a healthy body water percentage ensures that your body functions efficiently. The metabolic age level is related to your body's metabolic rate and helps you maintain the daily minimum level of energy or calories your body requires when resting or sleeping to function effectively. Even though your total body weight might not change drastically over time, your muscle mass and body fat levels may be changing. Keeping tabs on them can help you stay at a lower risk of certain diseases. As you become more active and reduce the amount of body fat, your physique rating will also change accordingly. The physique rating helps you maintain a diet and fitness program to achieve your desired level. And knowing your levels of visceral fat -- the fat in the abdominal cavity and surrounding the vital organs -- can help you keep heart disease and high blood pressure at bay, and may delay the onset of type two diabetes. In short, this monitor gives you essential information and greater control as you work to stay healthy and live a more active, vital life.

Operating on four AA batteries (included), the Tanita BC554 is intended for use by persons up to 330 pounds and is backed by Tanita's 3-year warranty.

Note: Pregnant women should not use this monitor, and if you have a pacemaker or other internal electronic medical device, you should not use the body fat reading feature.

Schiff Super Calcium 1200 with Vitamin D combines calcium and Vitamin D to promote bone and teeth health. Calcium is vital for building strong bones and teeth. It is also needed for muscle function, nerve function, hormone release, and to aid in the function of many enzymes. Vitamin D regulates the absorption of calcium so your body gets the calcium it needs. This supplement is specially formulated to dissolve quickly for fast, thorough absorption.

Calcium and Vitamin D work together to help build and maintain strong, healthy bones. Two Schiff Super Calcium softgels provide 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 800 IU of Vitamin D to help build healthy bones and teeth, reduce bone loss, and improve the absorption of calcium.

Calcium and Vitamin D taken as part of a well-balanced diet may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. While adequate Calcium intake is important, daily intakes above 2,000 mg are not likely to provide any additional benefit. Taking Schiff Super Calcium softgels can help ensure adequate calcium levels when diet doesn't provide enough.

This supplement has Schiff's Sure Dissolve formula, which means it's made to disintegrate in the body within one hour for improved absorption and less waste.

Schiff supplements are guaranteed for purity, freshness, and label potency.

Schiff, a leader in the natural supplement industry for more than 70 years, is one of the most trusted and respected nutrition brands due to its focus on research, innovation, and the delivery of high-quality dietary supplements. One of Schiff's major breakthroughs was its discovery that rose hips provided a more concentrated source of Vitamin C than orange juice. Schiff was also the first to introduce this Vitamin C source to America and to produce the first natural source multivitamin, Schiff V-Complette.

Schiff emphasizes the use of the finest ingredients to ensure every product meets strict standards for identity, purity, and stability.

Schiff Super Calcium-Magnesium Softgels contain key bone-building nutrients to help maintain strong bones. Adequate calcium and Vitamin D are important factors that may reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life. Magnesium helps the body utilize calcium and is necessary for production of cellular energy. When taken as directed, this fast-dissolving supplement can help keep bones healthy and strong and improve overall health.

Adequate calcium and Vitamin D intake throughout life, as part of a well-balanced diet, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Schiff Super Calcium-Magnesium softgels contain 1200 milligrams of calcium combined with 400 milligrams of magnesium, 800 IU of Vitamin D, and 3 milligrams of boron that help with calcium metabolism.

In addition to its bone-strengthing benefits, calcium is vital for building strong teeth, aiding muscle function, and the release of hormones and enzymes, along with assisting nerves in transmitting impulses.

Magnesium is a mineral that is needed for more than 100 enzymatic reactions in the body, including those for nerve and muscle function, regulation of body temperature, energy metabolism, and DNA and RNA synthesis. Along with aiding the absortion of calcium, magnesium also plays an important roles in cardiovascular health, mood, maintenance of bone mass, and the health of all tissues.

About Polar
The first EKG accurate wireless heart rate monitor was invented by Polar back in 1977 as a training tool for the Finnish National Cross Country Ski Team. The concept of ""intensity training"" by heart rate swept the athletic world in the eighties. By the 1990s, individuals were looking to heart rate monitors not only for performance training needs, but also for achieving everyday fitness goals. Today, the same concept of heart rate training is being used by world-class athletes as well as everyday people trying to lose weight. Polar is the leading brand among consumers, coaches, and personal trainers worldwide and the company is committed to not only producing the best products, but also being the leading educator on the benefits of heart rate based exercise.

1813,"The Health o meter 2 in 1 baby and toddler scale converts from infant tray style to traditional foot platform to adjust to your child’s growth. The scale is shaped in the face of a teddy bear, making it friendly for children of all ages. Includes the Healthy Growth Baby Book contains growth charts to help you monitor and track your child’s weight and height compared to national averages.

The Health-o-Meter HDC100-01 ""Grow with Me"" Teddy Bear Scale is a first-of-its kind consumer baby and toddler scale. As your child grows, the scale easily converts from a tray to a platform, making this a versatile and cost-effective device for weighing your child as he develops from a newborn to a toddler.

Operating the Scale
Place the scale on flat, level surface. A hard surface, such as a tile or linoleum floor, is the best for maximum accuracy. If the scale is placed on a soft, deep rug, then it may not produce accurate results. Once the scale is placed on an appropriate surface, press On/Off and wait for the display to show zeros. If the display shows ""0:0"", the scale is set to pounds/ounces; if the display shows ""0.00"" the scale is set to kilograms/grams. Press the lb/kg button to select between pounds or kilograms.

The scale can be operated with or without the tray. When using the tray, make sure that it is securely locked into place before placing your baby on the scale. Simply lay your baby on the tray and read the display. To use the scale without the tray, you'll need to remove the tray by turning the locking nut clockwise. The tray is replaced by four rubber plugs and a supplied plastic cover tab. Once the cover is in place, hold your baby upright on the scale, and place the baby's feet so that the weight is evenly distributed. Of course, everyone knows that a baby rarely holds still. Health o Meter has an answer. If your child is moving, press the ""Hold"" button to lock in the correct weight. This function displays the baby's average weight for the time period.

1885,"Do you want to lose weight or improve your total health and fitness? Then a Tanita BF-679W Body Fat / Body Water Monitor is the right addition to your routine. A weight scale alone is not enough. This monitor calculates body fat and body water levels using bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA); sending a safe, low-level electrical signal through the body. The BF-679 does not include Athlete Mode.

The Tanita BF679W Duo Scale Plus Body Fat Monitor can monitor both your body fat and body water percentages. This scale also features a daily calorie intake function that estimates how many calories should be consumed in a 24-hour period for a user to maintain current weight level, and a dual recall feature that compares both

Why You Should Monitor Body Water and Fat Percentage
If you're like most people, you're not drinking enough water. If you wait until you feel thirsty, your body is already suffering from the effects of mild dehydration. You continually lose water during the day through sweat, urine and breathing. The amount varies due to several reasons, including your physical activity level, illness, medications, poor nutrition, or even climatic conditions. Monitoring your body water percentage allows you to quickly compensate if your levels are low, allowing your body to function more efficiently. Having the right amount of water in your body will not only make you feel healthier, but you'll also reduce your risk of developing serious health problems in the longer term.

High body fat levels can reduce your endurance and have been linked to heart disease cancer and diabetes. Tanita's body composition analyzers monitor your body fat and body water levels with Bioelectric Impedance Analysis, or BIA, the same advanced technology used by doctors. Foot pads send a low-level electrical signal. Then BIA measures the resistance to this signal as it travels through the body.

The Tanita BF679W is calibrated for standard adults and children and stores data for 2 people and measures body fat in increments of 0.5 percentage points. This scale also features a guest mode, allowing you to use the unit without losing information already assigned to the personal keys. The scale's large, easy-to-read 2.25-inch, 2-line LCD shows weight and body fat simultaneously, and instantly compares these readings to healthy ranges based on the user's age and gender. Simply supply your gender, age, height and weight into the memory, step on the scale, and the monitor does the rest. The results are analyzed according to each user's information, and the result is the one of the most comprehensive at-home readings you can get.

Operating on four AA batteries (included), the Tanita BF679W is intended for use by persons up to 300 pounds and is backed by Tanita's three-year warranty.

It can also make an isotonic solution, equivalent to our regular blue colored packet, if mixed with 16 oz. (480 ml.) of water. Our regular product, the blue colored packet, makes an isotonic solution in 8 oz. (240 ml.) of water (using our SINUS RINSE bottle or other measuring devices). It is strongly recommended to use this Green packet only under the advice of your physician or using your judgment. A few research reports, plus feedback from some physicians and customers have reported additional benefits from using a hypertonic solution. If you experience any intolerable burning or stinging, please discontinue the use of the hypertonic solution.

Place your arm on a table so that the cuff is positioned at the same level as your heart. Rest comfortably in a relaxed environment for at least 15 minutes prior to taking your blood pressure measurement. Once you feel relaxed, begin inflating the cuff by rapidly squeezing the inflation bulb until you have reached approximately 30-40 mmHg higher than your normal systolic reading. If your normal systolic blood pressure reading is unknown, inflate the cuff to 180 mmHg (never inflate higher than 299 mmHg). When the desired pressure has been achieved, release the inflation bulb. Once inflation stops, the measurement is started. As the cuff deflates, decreasing numbers will appear on the display. When the measurement is complete the Heartbeat symbol stops flashing and your blood pressure and pulse rates are displayed on the screen. And remember, always consult your physician for specific information about your blood pressure.

Clinical studies have shown that fennel, as part of the diet, helps regulate contractions of the small intestine and aids gas expulsion. Fennel relaxes the gut to relieve spasms of the GI tract. Fennel assists in the dietary management of IBS symptoms, and is exceptional for IBS bloating, gas and abdominal pain. Fennel is also a traditional digestive aid for colic, heartburn, indigestion, and stomachaches. Packed in very generous quantities meant to be used daily as a medical food for IBS. Brew a delicious cup of tea several times a day, every day, as part of your dietary management of IBS symptoms. This tea is uniquely formulated to contain a high volatile oil content and whole seed size (integral to the quality and potency of fennel). Our fennel is carefully selected from the most recent possible harvest date, processed for minimal volatile oil dissipation, and packed to stay as fresh as possible. It’s the volatile oils in fennel that make it so effective for the dietary management of IBS symptoms, particularly bloating and gas. Certified organic and guaranteed to be the freshest, strongest, and most delicious fennel tea available. If you're used to drinking fennel tea from store-bought tea bags, you'll find the difference in strength and taste of Heather's Tummy Tea astonishing. Fennel is classified as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) by the FDA. Brew just as you would brew loose tea using any type of large tea strainer. Brew with freshly boiled hot water, but do not boil the herb in water as this destroys its volatile oils, and thus its effectiveness. The stronger you brew the tea the more effective it will be.

1943,"When nature calls, don’t let an itchy, uncomfortable rash slow you down! Tecnu Original Outdoor Skin Cleanser is a unique poison ivy soap designed to remove the rash-causing oil (urushiol) from your skin, and other contaminated areas, after exposure to poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac plants. Our special cleanser can be used before the rash begins or as soon as possible after it surfaces to wash away oils that cause the rash, itching and spreading. When used within 8 hours of exposure to poisonous plants, Tecnu can remove poison oak and ivy oil before the rash begins. As a first step in rash prevention, simply apply Tecnu directly to dry skin, rub vigorously for two minutes and rinse with water. Once a poison plant rash has started, Tecnu will help remove any toxic oil on the skin, thereby removing the source of the spreading. This allows the natural healing process to begin unimpeded. For best results, use cleanser as soon as the rash emerges and apply to entire body. Apply to un-wetted skin, rub for two minutes, rinse in a luke-warm shower and towel dry. Repeat as needed. Poison ivy and oak oil can also be spread from contaminated clothing, shoes, gloves, tools and pets. Since urushiol does not evaporate, it can remain on contaminated items for months or even years at a time. Use the cleanser to wash off the oil from items and help avoid a rash from secondary contact. In addition to removing rash-causing oils, the special soap can also be used to remove sap, pitch, grease and tar from skin. It is also highly effective to remove skunk odor from a dog or pet. Apply to tools or gear to remove urushiol. Prior to use, test on a small area. Tecnu products are designed for those who love the outdoors, adventure and exploring. Our product collection includes Tecnu Original Outdoor Skin Cleanser, Tecnu Extreme Poison Ivy and Oak Scrub, Tecnu Rash Relief Spray and Calagel Anti-Itch Gel.

The ES8077S Vortex Linear Pivot Shaver with HydraClean System is Panasonic's top-of-the-line shaver. It features an adjustable pivoting head for a more comfortable shave, and the pivoting head rocks up and down, and back and forth, to follow every contour of your face. You can even adjust the amount of pivot based on your preference with the Pivot Action Selector. This razor delivers maximum comfort and the support you need for a clean, close shave.



To properly shave with the Vortex, start out with gentle pressure on your face. It is important to note that your skin and beard need about 30 days to adjust to any new shaving method, so be patient. Once your skin becomes used to the shaver, you can increase the amount of pressure applied to your face, but remember that shaving should never be painful. And to maintain your razor's cutting performance, replace your out foil at least once a year and the inner blade once every two years.

There's nothing worse than a messy razor. Luckily, Panasonic knows that some of us aren't all that great at cleaning up, and they've created a winner with the HydraClean Hygienic Cleaning System. This powerful cleaning system automatically cleans, dries, and refreshes your shaver. Panasonic's long-lasting cleaning cartridge provides outstanding cleaning power that keeps your blades fresh and ready to go. Also, if you want a quick, easy clean for your razor, the Vortex offers a Turbo Cleaning Mode. Press and hold the on/off button to shift from 13,000 RPMs to an impressive 17,000 RPMs. Then simply rinse the shaver under water. The super-fast spinning blades will rush water through the razor, cleaning out hair, dust, and other debris. You cannot actually shave in Turbo Cleaning Mode because the blades are moving too fast to cut any hair, but it cleans the shaver in no time flat.

Wet or dry, the Vortex delivers a clean, smooth shave with the power to cut through even the nastiest of beards. This razor is fully immersible in water for a great shave in or out of the shower. With Panasonic's wet-or-dry technology, you can shave wet with lather or dry for a quick trim. When you're done shaving, simply rinse under clean water, click the Vortex into the HydraClean dock, and your razor will be ready the next morning.

Unlike a manual toothbrush, the Philips Sonicare Essence 5300 uses powerful Sonic technology to clean teeth with up to 31,000 movements per minute. These sweeping motions drive fluids deep into the tight spaces between your teeth and along your gum line, resulting in a cleaner, healthier mouth.

With a unique angled neck and contoured bristles that correspond to the natural shape of your teeth, the Sonicare Essence 5300 delivers a thorough, comfortable brushing experience. The angled neck provides optimum reach for the bristles, which have extra-soft rounded ends that gently massage your gums and go deep between teeth to remove plaque.

For further convenience, the Sonicare Essence 5300 features an Easy-start option that gently increases the toothbrush's power over the first 12 uses, so you can gradually adjust to the Sonic technology.

The Essence 5300 also features a Smartimer to keep you on track. The Smartimer encourages you to brush for a full two minutes, the time recommended by dental professionals. If you wish to pause or stop brushing during the two-minute cycle, just press the power button. If you press the power button again within 30 seconds, the Smartimer will pick up where you left off.

After a full 24-hour charge, the Essence 5300 will provide approximately two weeks of typical use (two minutes of brushing, twice a day). A convenient recharge indicator on the brush displays the available battery life and blinks when you need to recharge.

Because the Essence 5300 can last two weeks between charges, you can leave its charger at home for most of your travels. A travel case and hygienic travel cap are included for further on-the-go convenience.

2012,"At the heart of your training is the Polar T31 Coded Transmitter. Its purpose is simple: to transmit your heart rate to your wrist unit. Slim and light, the ECG (electrocardiogram) accurate transmitter is fully water resistant and designed for all weather conditions. Compatible heart rate monitors include, but are not limited to: FT1, FT2, FT4, FT7, FT40, FT60, FT80, RS100, RS300X, RS400, RCX5.

Slim, lightweight, and water-resistant, the Polar T31 coded transmitter and belt set accurately transmits your heart rate data to your Polar wrist-top computer. As a result, it's easy to monitor your heart rate during training runs. This version of the T31 coded, meaning it prevents crosstalk from other electronic devices to ensure complete accuracy (Polar also sells a non-coded T31). It's also built to last, with a design that holds up to 2,500 hours of training usage. The transmitter belt--which works with all current Polar wrist-top computers except the CS600 and RS800--includes a sealed transmitter and elastic strap.

About Polar
The first EKG accurate wireless heart rate monitor was invented by Polar back in 1977 as a training tool for the Finnish National Cross Country Ski Team. The concept of ""intensity training"" by heart rate swept the athletic world in the eighties. By the 1990s, individuals were looking to heart rate monitors not only for performance training needs, but also for achieving everyday fitness goals. Today, the same concept of heart rate training is being used by world-class athletes as well as everyday people trying to lose weight. Polar is the leading brand among consumers, coaches, and personal trainers worldwide and the company is committed to not only producing the best products, but also being the leading educator on the benefits of heart rate based exercise.





Getting Started
Getting started with your T31 Coded Transmitter is easy.  For best results, thoroughly moisten the back electrode areas of the transmitter with water and adjust the strap length to fit snug, but comfortable. Check that the moist electrode areas are firmly against your skin and that the Polar logo is in the upright position. Tip: When you are finished with your workout, remove the transmitter, rinse with water and dry with a soft towel.  Never store the transmitter wet, in a damp environment or in any kind of non-breathable material, such as a plastic bag or sports bag. Sweat and moisture may keep the electrodes wet and the heart rate sensor activated. This will shorten the battery life. Keep in a cool and dry place.

DIMENSIONS OF LIGHTER: Length: 1.50"""" x Width: 0.5"""" W xHeight: 2.25""
WEIGHT OF ZIPPO: 2.0 oz

About Zippo:
The Zippo timeline begins in the early 1930s, at the Bradford Country Club in Bradford, Pennsylvania. Mr. Blaisdell watched a friend struggle awkwardly to use a cumbersome, Austrian-made lighter. In late 1932 Mr. Blaisdell decided to reconstruct the Austrian lighter. He fabricated a small rectangular case and attached a lid with a hinge. He preserved the chimney design which protected the flame. The result was an attractive lighter that was easily operated with one hand. The name “Zippo” was created by Mr Blaisdell.

GUARANTEE:
In a world where most products are simply disposable or available with limited warranties, the Zippo pocket lighter remains backed by its famous lifetime guarantee. In more than 85 years, no one has ever spent a cent on the mechanical repair of a Zippo pocket lighter regardless of the lighter’s age or condition. The Zippo pocket lighter is ingrained in American culture and is a global icon of durability and reliability.

Naturade soy-free veg is pure vegetable protein. This unique blend of high-quality protein from pea, rice, potato, barley and spirulina provides a balanced supply of amino acids. Methionine and lysine are added to match the amino acid profile of animal protein. This all-natural product has absolutely no animal, egg or dairy derivatives.

Naturade soy-free veg assures that you get all the amino acids in the right proportion, including all the essential amino acids that your body can't produce on its own. Naturade soy-free veg is fortified with 100 percent of the daily value of vitamin b-12, plus 8 mg of iron and 150 mg of calcium per serving. The amount of these nutrients is usually inadequate in an all-vegetable diet. Naturade soy-free veg is formulated with pea protein that has not been genetically modified.

Discover the secret of the delicious and energizing Acai Berry (pronounced ah-sigh-EE) in Garden GreensTM AcaiSplashTM Drink Mix. The Acai Berry grows on top of lush palm trees in the heart of planet Earth, the Amazon Rainforest. The small, oval shaped, Acai Berry is deep violet in color and is naturally rich in polyphenols and anthocyanins, two of nature's most potent antioxidant.

The Acai Berry has been consumed by South American Indians for hundred of generations and has been treasured for its health benefits. After crushing and straining the Acai Berry, the Indians either sip the honey-sweetened juice as a refreshing beverage or combine it with granola and banana as an energizing meal.

In addition to the Acai Berry, AcaiSplash TM contains other nutrient rich berry extracts such as Raspberry, Lycium, Bilberry, Blueberry, Elderberry, Blackberry, and Cranberry. All these berries are combined with Grape Skin, Green Tea, Cherry, and Pomegranate extracts to give you 100 mg of anthocyanins per serving.

ORAC stands for Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity and is a new standard of measurement jointly developed by the National Institutes on Aging and the USAD Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging. In simple term, ORAC measures how well a food or a drink renders free radical inactive. Since free radicals can damage healthy cells in the body, the higher the ORAC value the better.

Who would have ever thought one little sheet could do so much? With Bounce dryer sheets, your clothes will be so soft you may find others drawn toward you. But not because of static—cling, we’ve got that under control. You’ll also find your clothes with less lint and hair sticking around. This simple little sheet might just change the way you feel about laundry—and the way your laundry feels.

* Keep out of reach of toddlers & pets to avoid accidental ingestion.

**Make sure to remove Bounce sheets before wearing your gym shoes.

How does Bounce soften?
During the tumbling of the dryer, fabric-care agents are transferred from the Bounce dryer sheet to the surface of fabrics. These fabric-care agents have a lubricating effect on the fabric, causing fibers to feel smooth.

How does Bounce control static?
If your socks cling to each other and snap at you when you try to pull them apart, that’s static cling. Static is known to build up in the dryer when fabric fibers, especially synthetics, rub together, generating friction. As a result of the friction between fibers, electrons are transferred across surfaces resulting in a static charge and that annoying high-pitched sound when you touch them.

Bounce works in the dryer, where static happens. Softening ingredients are transferred from the Bounce dryer sheet to the surface of fabrics via heat and physical contact during the tumbling of the dryer. Lubricating fiber surfaces with Bounce fabric softener helps prevent the friction that leads to static charge.

Can I reuse my Bounce sheet?
Why would you? In the U.S., the average cost of our dryer sheets is just pennies per sheet, so you can afford to use a new one every time. Plus, you’ll get better softening and static control when using a new sheet in every dryer load, especially since most of the fabric conditioner is used up in one use. A reused sheet will not provide nearly the same great benefit as a new one.

How do I use Bounce with small loads, such as one blouse?
Bounce was developed to use in a full load of damp fabrics. Tossing a Bounce sheet in the dryer with only one wet or dry garment can lead to staining. If you’ve washed your blouse and want to dry it with a Bounce sheet, we suggest adding a damp bath towel to the load.

How do fabric-conditioner stains occur?
Too heavy concentration of fabric conditioner—single items or small loads need help distributing the fabric conditioner. Try adding a damp bath towel or other heavyweight fabric to help even it out.

Fabrics that attract fabric conditioner, like certain polyesters, are prone to spotting. Check your garment-care tag; it might recommend “no fabric softener.” If you have fabric-conditioner spotting on a garment, it might be prone to spotting.

Dry loads—Bounce was designed to be used with damp fabrics. Fabric-conditioner stains are usually temporary. To remove them, rub wet fabric/stained area with a bar of soap, then rewash the garment in warm water.

Is Bounce safe for my dryer?
You’re in luck! Yes, based on our testing, Bounce is safe for all major brands of North American dryers. The following manufacturers have approved Bounce for use in their dryers: Amana, GE, Inglis, Whirlpool, Kenmore, and Maytag.

Can I use Bounce in my washer?
No. Bounce was developed for use in the dryer.

Can I use Bounce on my baby’s clothes?
Bounce shouldn’t be used on children’s sleepwear or other garments labeled as flame-resistant because it might reduce flame resistance.

I’m sensitive to perfume. Can I still use Bounce?
Try Bounce Free & Sensitive. It’s dermatologist-tested and mild on skin.

Is Bounce safe for use on white clothes?
Yes, all Bounce products are safe for use on white clothing.

What good is a cleaning product if it leaves behind ugly streaks, smudges and residue that you have to clean up again?  The Granite Gold Daily Cleaner creates an absolutely flawless, streak-free result. 

A helpful cleaning tip is to use a circular motion when wiping off the solution. The counter cleaner is non-toxic, non-acidic and contains no phosphates or ammonia.  This daily cleaner is biodegradable, pH balanced and safe to use on food prep surfaces.

Use it on many natural stone surfaces other than granite.  It is a fantastic daily cleaner for marble, limestone, travertine, onyx and slate. Granite Gold can be used on any finish and it also works great on engineered surfaces like ceramic tile, porcelain tile, concrete, Formica, and quartz surfaces such as Corian, Silestone, Terrazzo, Caesarstone, Cambria, and more.  Granite Gold Daily Cleaner is proudly made in the USA.

2212,"In 1969, Douglas G. Howard set out to solve this dilemma: how can you eliminate blemishes in wood finishes and restore the original color and luster without removing any of the existing finish? Unable to find an answer at his local hardware store, he went to work in his garage to create his own product. His goal was to make something that would be much more than a surface treatment, yet nothing like a stripper or a refinisher. The key was to develop a formula that could clean and polish the surface, penetrate the finish with stain, and leave the original finish intact. The end result was Restor-A-Finish, Doug Howard's first in what would become a complete line of wood care products. For over 40 years, Howard's Restor-A-Finish has been a standard in the antique industry. Because Restor-A-Finish preserves the original wood finish it also helps preserve its authenticity and value, whereas stripping the finish may literally strip the piece of its value. Almost any existing wood tone, from a Birdseye Maple to a Jacobean, can be closely matched using one of the nine available finish colors. Trying it on just about everything with a traditional wood finish, antique dealers, refinishers, and homemakers have found it to be a safer and easier alternative to stripping and refinishing. Scratches, oxidation, white heat rings, watermarks, smoke damage, and sun fade simply disappear.

2260,"Triple Flex offers the triple action of glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM. The main components of joint cartilage are chondrocytes, collagen and proteoglycans. Glucosamine supports the build-up of proteoglycan. Studies show glucosamine may help maintain cartilage and stimulate growth of cartilage cells. Chondroitin, in a process involving its attachment to glucosamine, plays a role in catching and holding water in the cartilage, contributing to its resilience. MSM is a natural source of dietary sulfur. Sulfur plays an especially critical role in maintaining the elasticity and flexibility of the connective tissue that make up joints. The 3 components found in Triple Flex work together to support joint health and mobility, contributing to a healthy and active lifestyle. Triple Flex is recommended to be part of a daily regimen for Bone/Joint Health. Unlike pain relievers, TripleFlex works with your body to naturally improve joint comfort, mobility and flexibility. TripleFlex does this by replenishing the body with critical nutrients needed for daily maintenance and renewal of your joints. Triple-Ingredient, Triple-Action & Triple Benefit Glucosamine: This is nature’s basic building block for maintaining joint cartilage. It helps to maintain structural integrity of the connective tissues of your joints. Chondroitin: This is a naturally occurring nutrient found in the connective tissues that lubricates and cushions your joints. MSM or Methylsulfonylmethane: A source of dietary sulfur that plays a critical role in the elasticity and flexibility of the connective tissue of your joints. New Optimized Formula: America's #1 triple-action triple strength joint care supplement TripleFlex is now even better in a new and improved optimized formula that uses the latest science for even better joint care with: Glucosamine, Chondroitin & MSM. * No Artificial Flavors * No Preservatives * No Chemical Solvents, Yeast, Starch or Gluten

In 1971, Arran Stephens and a business partner opened Canada's first large organic supermarket, LifeStream. Founded on the ideal of serving delicious, wholesome foods grown and processed in harmony with nature, the store soon expanded into milling, baking, making muesli, granolas, alfalfa sprouts, nut butters, energy bars, and wholesale distribution. Within a few years, the LifeStream line had grown to include a wide range of products, including both natural and organic whole grain foods and soy-based vegetarian entrees. The company even published its own vegetarian cookbook, which sold over 125,000 copies. Annual sales at LifeStream reached $9 million, making the line one of Canadas leading natural food brands at the time. LifeStream sales continued to grow to $12 million, but an awkward partnership led to the sale of the company in 1981. It eventually was acquired by Kraft/Phillip Morris.

Then in 1985, Arran and his wife, Ratana, started a new venture christened Natures Path, from the back of their natural foods restaurant. The companys first product, Sprouted Organic Manna Bread, debuted at the Natural Products Expo in Anaheim, Calif. Organic Multigrain, Multigrain & Raisin, and Millet Rice Flakes were the very first Natures Path cereals and remain as popular as ever. By 1989, building on the success of its cereals, the company had grown 800%. To meet demand, acreage was bought and a 54,000 square foot organic processing plant was built in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. This was the first third-party certified organic cereal plant in the world. Later, ten years after starting Nature's Path, the Stephens family purchased back LifeStream from Kraft. Since, the company has continue to expand its facilities and the brands and products it offers--adding waffles, additional cereals, granola and energy bars, flaxseed meal, baking mixes, and more.

2436,"

“Casual name, great product!” It’s a good thing that we have a sense of humor! Yes, many people believe that our products named “Preggie Pops” & “Queasy Pops” could not possibly come from a serious background. Believe it or not, “Preggie Pops” & “Queasy Pops” were conceived and developed by health care professionals! In our line of work, we are daily witnesses to how debilitating nausea can be. We also came to realize that not every nausea remedy works for every person or situation, and that many people would prefer not to take a prescription if they can avoid it. We found that a lot of our patients wanted something “natural”.

With all that in mind, we did some research into natural pharmacologic agents, reading through the available literature (both scientific and non-scientific), talking to numerous other health care professionals from a number of disciplines, and most importantly, talking directly to nausea sufferers. Many patients were willing to share their favorite home remedies, and through time and research, we were able to determine which ones really work. We discovered which herbs are truly helpful, and developed flavors that would be appealing to anyone with a queasy stomach.

As healthcare professionals, we have dedicated our life’s work to helping people in need. Our friends in the field have welcomed our natural products as an alternative therapy for their patients, and the feedback has been great! From traditional practitioners to the holistic and wellness communities, there seems to be a universal market for a flavorful and simple remedy that makes life a little easier during nauseous times. We are thrilled to offer our customers a tasty way to ease their nausea and help them through difficult times.

The first pre-soaped steel wool pad was invented in 1917 by a cooking utensil salesman named Irving Cox. His pad kept pots and pans looking clean and new without scratches or abrasions. Cox's invention became the first product for the company coined by his wife as Save Our Saucepans, or S.O.S. Almost a century later, S.O.S products are go-to items in millions of homes for safely scrubbing cookware as well as cleaning bathroom and kitchen surfaces.

With two speed settings and a lightweight, ergonomic design, the Wahl All-Body massager allows you to relieve aches and muscle pain in the comfort of your own home. For a customized experience, the massager includes seven separate attachments that provide different types of massage, from a light touch for facials to a deep tissue massage. A contoured, multi-grip handle offers a sure grip and easy maneuverability.



A facial attachment provides a smooth surface for a light, gentle massage to the face, while the scalp massager stimulates blood flow to your brain using acupressure points. Two different attachments for muscle groups--for kneading and deep muscle massage--provide the stimulation you need for areas like the back and hamstrings.

A specialized knuckle and joint attachment is shaped like a triangle so it can fit into those hard-to-reach joint areas, and a spot application attachment provides pinpoint pressure wherever you need it the most. Finally, a general body attachment offers soothing and calming massage for anywhere on the body.

Ergonomic Design with Multi-Grip
The compact, lightweight All-body Massager is designed with an ergonomic handle that helps you avoid awkward angles and uncomfortable positions. A multi-grip prevents slipping and allows you to reach every part of your body. For added convenience, the portable massager is small enough to toss into a suitcase or gym bag.

Two-Speed Settings
The massager offers two speed settings--a low setting for a light, soothing massage, and a high setting when you prefer intense, deep penetration for large muscle groups. It plugs into a standard outlet for convenience and delivers a powerful massage with a whisper-quiet motor.

Get your bare floors sparkling clean with this versatile and lightweight Bissell dual-function cleaner. With one quick flip you can switch back and forth between heated wet and dry cleaning for a complete floor cleansing with one 10 pound machine. The dry mode picks up crumbs, pet hair and dirt. Switch to the heated wet mode and a fingertip control dispenses cleaning solution while the soft-scrub brush and an interchangeable pad does the job on various floor surfaces. The built-in heater with on/off switch allows you to select heated cleaning for sticky, hard-to-clean areas. Other handy features include a cord clip, quick-release cord wrap, carry handle, filter, cleaning solutions and separate clean and dirty tanks. Brush and pads are machine washable. Includes trial size hard floor cleaner, trial size wood floors cleaner and an extra pad.

The Bissell Flip-It Select promises two hard-surface cleaners in one: a dry vacuum for picking up crumbs and a heated wet-mop for sticky spills. Replacing broom, dustpan, vacuum cleaner, mop, and bucket in one fell stroke, this slender, lightweight cleaner effectively simplifies and saves space, especially in crowded spaces like kitchens. Start by using it as a regular stick vacuum to clear away small debris. To change functions, simply turn the unit around, switching on the built-in heater for added cleaning power. The Flip-It has separate clean and dirty water tanks, so unlike the traditional mop-bucket combo, you're always working with freshly heated, unsoiled water, and it leaves floor dry once they've been cleaned. It also comes with two different wet cleaning surfaces, a soft brush for tile or other surfaces with grout and crevices, and the Gentle Clean pad for babying delicate surfaces like hardwood or laminates.

The Flip-It's dual-function cleaning proves especially convenient on smaller areas and for touchups, but mastering the wet-mop function can be tricky, and many users find it hard to push in wet mode until the floor has been saturated with liquid. Technique (and practice) help the process considerably: press the trigger down on the forward stroke to spray cleaning fluid, then release it as you pull back so the squeegee dries the floor. The Flip-It Select is easy to maintain; both filter and brushes clean up easily under running water and the Gentle Clean pad can go straight into the washing machine. It even stores ready to use with water and cleaning fluid in the tank. Weighing in at just ten pounds, the unit is powered by a nine-amp motor when using heat, three amps without, and includes trial sizes of hard-surface and wood-floor cleaners as well as an extra Gentle Clean pad. The power cord features a quick-release wrap as well as a clip for storage. Compact, maneuverable, and ergonomically designed, the Flip-It Select is 44 inches tall, with a base measuring 11 inches long and 8 inches wide, and comes backed by a limited one-year warranty. --Mary Park

Wrist blood pressure monitors are portable, accurate and simple to use. They provide a convenient choice for those who want a second unit for away from home or who have trouble placing a cuff on their arm. The Omron HEM-650 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with APS (Advanced Positioning Sensor) uses Omron's patented IntelliSense technology, which inflates the wrist cuff to the ideal level with each use and offers fast, personalized, and automatic inflation for maximum comfort. No adjustments are required to select an inflation level--especially convenient for hypertensive users and for people with certain arrhythmia or heart disorders, because their blood pressure is more likely to fluctuate. And with the HEM-650's 90-memory recall with date and time stamp, as well as averaging capabilities for the last three readings, you can track your blood pressure and pulse progress as your work towards a healthier lifestyle. The HEM-650 also features a system that detects an irregular heartbeat, giving you an even better understanding of your heart's health. Plus, you'll have additional peace of mind knowing that the HEM-650 comes with a 5-year warranty.

Because the HEM-650 has a wrist cuff, it is particularly helpful if you have a larger than average sized arm. The monitor fits those with a wrist size of 5.25 to 8.5 inches, and it ensures easier and more comfortable use. Note, however, that a wrist monitor does require proper positioning of the device at the heart level. Correct cuff positioning is critical when monitoring blood pressure, fortunately, the HEM-650 features an advanced positioning sensor that automatically confirms that the cuff is level with the user's heart, thereby ensuring an accurate reading.

It is critical that when using a blood pressure monitor the cuff is the appropriate size and is properly applied. An ill-fitting cuff or an incorrectly-applied cuff can result in inaccurate readings. Consult your doctor or the included instructions for the proper application of the cuff.

This Green colored packet will make a Hypertonic (higher concentration) solution when mixed with 8 oz. (240 ml.) of water. It can also make an isotonic solution, equivalent to our regular blue colored packet, if mixed with 16 oz. (480 ml.) of water. Our regular product, the blue colored packet, makes an isotonic solution in 8 oz. (240 ml.) of water (using our SINUS RINSE bottle or other measuring devices). It is strongly recommended to use this Green packet only under the advice of your physician or using your judgment. A few research reports, plus feedback from some physicians and customers have reported additional benefits from using a hypertonic solution. If you experience any intolerable burning or stinging, please discontinue the use of the hypertonic solution. In my opinion, apart from transient, mild burning, it will not cause any permanent damage with a few uses. With time, you will be able to judge as far as what concentration of saline works best for you. What is the difference between the Pediatric Kit and the regular kit? NeilMed s Pediatric Sinus Rinse bottle has a volume capacity of 4 oz. (120 ml.), and an aperture (opening) on top of the cap of 3/32 in. (2.5 mm).

Both systems are designed to give the same concentration of solution. Children or adults who feel that the volume of the regular 8 oz. (240 ml.) bottle with the 3/16 in. (4.5 mm) cap is too large, should consider trying the pediatric kit. The therapeutic benefits will be identical. Please do not use our regular blue colored.

Panasonic WES9012PC Replacement blade and foil combo for your Panasonic Shaver To help maintain the level of grooming performance you demand from your shaver, the precision blades you depend on should be replaced once every year* to ensure outstanding closeness and comfort.

Why replace your blades?
Over time, your shaver's blades can become dulled and pitted, creating skin discomfort and a less than satisfying shave experience.
Replace with Panasonic Blades:
Genuine Panasonic ultra-thin, ultra-sharp blades are made from premium Japanese stainless steel. Each blade reflects the centuries-old traditions of skill and expertise in crafting the high-quality steels once used to create Japan's legendary swords.
Why replace your foils?
After months of daily shaving, the ultra-thin, ultra-smooth foils on your shaver can wear too thin, resulting in a lack of flexibility, less efficient performance and a less than optimal shaving experience.

WES9012PC Features:

The perfect thirty degree edge
Quick, easy installation

Salt water gargle is recommended by family physicians, the National Institute of Health and the Harvard Medical School as an effective remedy for irritated throats. Keep single use doses of Simply Gargle at: home, office, auto, workplace. Take at the first sign of sore throat. Easy snap-off tip. Made in USA.

Salt water gargles have been recommended by family physicians, the National Institute of Health, and Harvard Medical School as an effective remedy for irritated throats. Now, with Simply Gargle, you can carry a salt water gargle with you wherever you go. The Simply Gargle Salt Water Rinse soothes and comforts a dry or irritated throat. Simply break off the packet's tab, gargle the solution in the back of your through for 15-30 seconds, and spit it out in your sink. It's important not to swallow the rinse, but the process may be repeated throughout the day to help ease your symptoms.

As the name implies, the gargle's ingredients are simple. Starting with a base of purified water, sodium chloride (salt), sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), and benzoic acid, Simply Gargle then adds a variety of healthy antioxidants, including witch hazel, grape seed, sage, rosemary, and rosehips extracts, and plenty of Vitamin C. Combine all this into one convenient packet, and you have a healthy rinse that fits in your pocket or purse.

So, why does gargling with salt water relieve sore throat ailments? The answer isn't as simple as you'd think. Sore throats hurt because they are inflamed. Usually, the inflammation is due to a viral or bacterial infection, such as the common cold or streptococcus. However, sore throats may also be related to allergies or physical injury to the throat. In each case, an inflammatory response has been triggered. Pain, swelling and an itchy or irritated sensation are the common symptoms of this inflammatory response (the medical term for swelling is edema). As part of the inflammatory response, there is an increase in the water content of the involved tissues. With respect to sore throats, a sense of fullness or difficulty swallowing are both related to edema of the tissue lining the throat (mucosa).

As you know, water tends to follow salt. For example, when you salt slices of raw eggplant the salt draws the moisture from the vegetable. After a few minutes you can see beads of fluid on the surface of the slices. Everyone has a different recipe for a salt water gargle, but all recipes tend to be fairly salty. If the gargle has a higher salt concentration than your intrinsic salt concentration, then it will tend to draw out some of the edema fluid from the mucosa of the throat. This will make some of your ""sore throat"" symptoms feel better. In some cases, gargling with salt water also has a cleansing action. If you are suffering from postnasal drainage due to a bacterial sinus infection or allergies, the mucus that drains from your nasal cavity is full of chemicals that tend to promote an inflammatory response. As this stuff drains down the back of your throat, it leaves a trail of inflamed tissue in its wake. Frequent gargling with salt water will help minimize these symptoms, too.

This product is most effective for daily use to clean and refresh contact lenses. Opti-Free Supra Clens Daily Protein Remover is a preservative-free solution that contains a highly purified active cleaning ingredient: porcine pancreatic enzymes. While wearing contact lenses throughout the day, the lens will develop a film on the surface made of protein and other substances. This protein remover helps enzymatically break up the surface film and remove it from the lenses. This solution should be used simultaneously with multi-purpose disinfecting solution during the soaking process to achieve optimal clean. Opti-Free Supra Clens Daily Protein Remover is not for use while the contact is directly in the eye, but should be used while the contact is being stored and cleaned in the lens case. This solution is specifically for use on soft contact lenses and should not be used with RGP lenses. In order to get the best cleaning results possible, place the contact lens in the case with the multi-purpose disinfecting solution and add one drop of the Opti-Free Supra Clens Daily Protein Remover. Afterwards, shake gently to ensure that mixing occurs and leave in the case for a minimum of 6 hours or preferably overnight. After this process has been completed and the lens has been rinsed thoroughly, proceed by placing contacts into eyes and wear throughout the day with constant moisture and comfort.

Powder powers away 24-hour-stuck-on-food

Formulated with the grease-fighting power of Dawn

For a virtually flawless clean, try this Cascade dish routine. First, wash dishes with Cascade Complete Powder for a complete clean. Then, to prevent spotting and filming on dishes, use Cascade Complete Rinse Aid. And to help clean limescale, grease, and odors away from your dishwasher, try Cascade Dishwasher Cleaner.

For a more convenient clean, try Cascade Complete ActionPacs and Cascade Platinum Pacs.

What temperature should my water be?
You can wash your dishes in hot or cold water, since our products are formulated to perform in any water temperature. Try helping to save energy by washing in cold water. You’ll find you get a great clean, with less energy used. If you prefer to hand-wash using hot water, try Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Beauty.

What should I do if I have hard water?
All of our dish products are designed to work effectively in all kinds of water hardness. Our dishwasher pacs, like Cascade All-in-1 Pacs, are formulated with water softeners to help fight hard-water deposits on your dishes and—as always—are the perfect dose.

Is there a correct way to load the dishwasher?
When you’re loading your dishwasher, it helps to put dishes in the best position for cleaning. Load all dirty dishes so they’re separated and facing the center, and always put plastic items on the top rack of the dishwasher. You can begin by placing large platters, cookie sheets, baking dishes, and pans around the perimeter of the bottom drawer. Next, add your plates. Stagger large dinner plates and smaller salad plates to give each dish more exposure. Set large and medium-size bowls in the remaining space in a slanted or completely downward position for optimal cleaning. Place dirty silverware in the cutlery container.

To organize the top drawer, line downward-facing glasses and mugs along the outer edges. Add bowls and extra-small saucers to the center section, placing each on a slant to create extra space. As a rule, the bottom drawer of your dishwasher is exposed to more heat than the top, so place plastic items on the higher drawer to avoid melting and warping. Gently nest stemware along the left-hand side—many dishwashers feature a protective holder for these items. Be sure to check the height of your stemware before closing the drawer to avoid broken glass!

In the small pockets of space between your top-drawer dishes, lay long, slender items like tongs and spatulas. Last, be sure no items block the sprayer arms, which can prevent water from reaching all of your dishes.

How do I ensure my dishes dry properly in the dishwasher?
Use a rinse aid, which is designed to ensure dishes dry properly in your dishwasher. Cascade Rinse Aid is specifically formulated to give you outstanding spot and film protection along with amazing shine. Our rinse aid helps to rinse away food particles and residues that can cause spots on dishes. Load the dishwasher so that all items are properly tilted for good drainage. Avoid nesting of dishes and silverware by staggering shapes and sizes and placing utensil handles both upward and downward. If available, use the ""heat dry"" option.

It may be better absorbed and more effective as an antioxidant than alpha-lipoic acid. R-lipoic acid by itself may be 10 times more effective than other forms of lipoic acid and has been called the mitochondrial antioxidant because it is a key component of mitochondrial dehydrogenase complexes, which may help to slow the natural aging process in animals. Also, animal research has shown that R-lipoic acid can increase or maintain levels of other antioxidants including CoQ10, Vitamin C, Vitamin E and glutathione, which may decline with age, more efficiently than other forms of lipoic acid (These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

2991,"Source Naturals Alpha Lipoic Acid Timed Release is designed to be released gradually throughout the day. It is a potent antioxidant and is active in both fat- and water-soluble regions of the cells. This makes ALA quite rare and this is why it is called “the universal antioxidant.” ALA also supports healthy sugar metabolism, liver function and energy generation. It is a critical component of an enzyme that generates acetyl coenzyme A, the start of the Krebs cycle that produces ATP in the mitochondria. ATP is the main source of energy for all muscle contractions and almost all other activities that our cells perform. Most of all, ALA is recognized as a powerful antioxidant because it has the unique ability to reactivate helpful compounds like vitamin C, glutathione, vitamin E, and CoQ10, enabling them to do more for your health. The suggested use is 1 tablet daily with or without a meal. For maximum results include vitamin B complex, magnesium and coenzyme Q10 with alpha-lipoic acid in your nutrition program.
