19,"The Shure SM57 is a fixture in the music business. You see it everywhere. In small clubs and 100,000 seat stadiums. This renowned mic is used by legendary performers and the latest up-and-comers. What you may not have seen are the thousands of SM57s at work behind the scenes in professional recording studios around the world. In fact, you'll probably find it in more studios than any other mic. Not surprising. The unidirectional dynamic SM57 has set the industry standard by defining the way instruments should sound. Which is why it's used by any serious musician or recording professional. Its warm, clean sound along with its carefully contoured presence rise make it ideal for a wide range of instrument miking applications, particularly guitar amplifiers and drums. The SM57 features a uniform cardioid pick-up pattern that isolates the main sound source and minimizes background noise.



Few microphones have the reputation for quality and durability that the SM57 has built up since it first hit the market in 1965. Since then, this product has been an industry benchmark to which all other studio microphones have been compared. It can be seen anywhere, from small clubs to sports stadiums, and has been used in the studio by many of the world’s greatest musicians. The Shure SM57 is also the microphone of choice for the White House, providing voice projection for the President since the 1970s.

The Shure brand ensures a long-lasting product that can withstand years of road or studio use. The SM57 was put through Shure’s famous drop test, in which the microphone was dropped ten times from a height of ten feet with no loss in input quality. Buyers can be confident in the durability of this microphone, exposing it to hours in the studio or the elements of an outdoor performance. The SM57 uses a cardioid pickup pattern to focus specifically on one source, rejecting audio from outside the pickup area. This can also be a great asset in live performances, as you can position the microphone wherever you like and not worry about feedback.

The SM57 is one of the most versatile microphones on the market. This dynamic product can handle the highest sound pressure levels without distortion, making it the perfect choice for recording high-volume instruments like drums. Many hit recordings feature the SM57 on the snare, as it can handle the noise without distortion. This product is also perfect for use with high-volume amplifiers. The SM57 can even handle close up recording on half-stack amps that are painfully loud for human ears. This microphone will help you to bring the feel of a live performance to your recordings for a better representation of your music. While this microphone is notorious for being used in the studio to record the sounds of percussion, wind, and string instruments, it also provides high quality vocal recording. Whether you are using it for spoken word or vocals, the SM57 will deliver a flawless sound while eliminating background noises. Because of its reliability, sound isolation, and quality sound reproduction, the SM57 has been used at the podium for Presidential speeches for the past 40 years.

The SM57 differs from microphones that are manufactured solely for vocal pickup in many ways. Vocal microphones like the SM58 have their frequency dialed in to a certain range that is common in most singers, enhancing that microphone’s pickup of the human voice. The SM57 doesn’t have this specific tuning, so it can handle frequencies on a much wider scale, with a response from 40Hz to 15KHz. Without this tuning, the microphone takes in the sound exactly as it is played, creating a perfect recording every time. This is even preferred by some vocalists who want only the raw input of their voice with no tuning at all.



"
20,"A standard on stages throughout the world for years, the Shure SM58 Dynamic Vocal Microphone offers a carefully tailored frequency rise at about 4,000 Hz for smooth as silk vocals that stand out in the mix. Long associated with its unmistakable sound and unsurpassed reliability, the Shure SM58 Dynamic Vocal Microphone is widely considered the most popular mic in the world. Designed for professional vocal use in sound reinforcement and studio recording, the Shure SM58 Dynamic Vocal Microphone utilizes a highly effective, built-in, spherical filter that minimizes wind and breath pop noise while the cardioid pickup pattern isolates the main sound source and minimizes unwanted background noise. The tailored vocal response on the SM58 is a legendary tone that has become a world standard. Shure SM58 Dynamic Vocal Microphone Features: Smooth, mid-frequency presence rise for world-famous SM58 Mic, sound Uniform cardioid pickup pattern isolates the main sound source, Minimizes background noise, Pneumatic shock-mount system cuts down handling noise, Rugged construction for extreme reliability in demanding applications, Effective, built-in spherical wind and pop filter, 50 to 15,000 Hz frequency response, Supplied with break-resistant stand, adapter which rotates 180 degrees, Legendary Shure quality, ruggedness, and reliability. Includes a mic stand adapter and a zippered storage pouch. Proximity Effect: When the sound source is less than 1/4 inch from the microphone, the microphone boosts bass frequencies (by 6 to 10 dB at 100 Hz), creating a warmer and richer bass sound than when farther away. This effect, known as proximity effect, happens only in unidirectional dynamic microphones like the Shure SM58 Vocal Mic. The low-frequency roll-off on the SM58 provides greater control, allowing the user to take full advantage of proximity effect.

This 6-inch cable has right angle plugs so you can place your pedals very close together without unnecessary lengths of cable lying on the floor. This works to clean up your rig and eliminate unwanted noise. Hosa's injection-molded cable terminations, for which they have become famous, have a built-in strain relief and carry their no-questions-asked Limited Lifetime Warranty. Recording studios, stage racks, keyboards and effects devices all can be connected with molded assemblies like their CPP-, CPR-, and CRA-series cables and snakes which perform just as well as much more expensive cables with metal-headshell assemblies. Hosa began business in 1984 with the belief that less-expensive doesn't have to mean ""cheaper"", and that it simply isn't necessary to connect your equipment with ""NASA-approved"", gold-plated cables thick enough to tow an eighteen-wheeler. So, if you can't afford to spend a week's equipment allowance for a few cables then look no further than the Hosa brand for professional cables that work as hard as you do. In the regular Hosa line, they pay strict attention to the basics of cable design and construction. They make sure that their cables are well-shielded from external sources of radio-frequency and current-induced noise and that they're of the proper gauge and of high copper purity to ensure low capacitance. In addition, Hosa uses correct soldering techniques to eliminate ""cold-solder"" joints which could cause intermittent connections or ""ground hums"". And finally they make sure that the jacket and head-shell/strain-relief combination are rugged enough to withstand the rigors of the intended application. Hosa provides all of these benefits in every cable they make, and they back them up with a Limited Lifetime Warranty.

The Jasmine S-34C is a stylish grand orchestra-style guitar with a rich, well-balanced sound and a graceful Venetian-style cutaway that represent exceptional value. Great for any player seeking a well-built and easy-playing guitar, the S-34C features a select spruce top with Jasmine's Advanced ""X"" Bracing, and sapele back and sides. The slim neck and full 25 1/2"" scale length provide comfortable feel and excellent playability, and the smooth satin finish maximizes resonance for optimal sound quality.Other great features include a rosewood fingerboard and bridge, full body binding and chrome tuners.

If you look inside an acoustic guitar, you'll see a series of sculpted wood pieces attached to the underside of the instrument's top. These sculpted wood pieces comprise the guitar's bracing. The primary function of the bracing is to support and maintain the structural stability of the guitar's top. Bracing can also dramatically affect the way the guitar sounds, depending on how it's constructed and its arrangement (called the bracing pattern).

There are many different types of bracing patterns. The most common and enduring pattern used on steel-string acoustic guitars is called ""X"" bracing; so named for the two braces that form an ""X"" by crossing each other in the middle of the pattern.

Not all ""X"" bracing patterns are created equal, however. Jasmine's ""Advanced X Bracing"" system features a ""forward-shifted"" ""X"" bracing pattern that places the braces closer to the soundhole, producing a livelier, more open sound with improved definition and note detail.

The quartersawn braces provide exceptional stability, with a scalloped design that reduces weight and lets the top vibrate more freely, resulting in better sound. A solid rosewood bridge plate rounds out this remarkable package by providing superior balance and note separation.





The NEX guitar body is a scaled-down Jumbo at heart. It has a silky balance to the tone that supports vocals beautifully.

Get louder, get quieter, or get modulated with the FOOT CONTROLLER FCV100. This versatile pedal works equally well as a volume pedal or a modulation pedal.

By turning the MIN VOL control, you can determine the minimum volume you wish to achieve. You can power this pedal with a 12 V DC Power adapter (not included) or a 9V battery.

Unlike other string brands, Elixir Strings coats the whole string. This protects not only the outer string surface but also the gaps between the windings where common tone-deadening gunk typically builds up in other brands’ coated and uncoated guitar strings. Anti-Rust Plating on plain steel strings ensures longer tone life for the entire set. Who wouldn’t love more quality playing time between the hassle and cost of string changes? Engineered to endure, these acoustic strings constructed with phosphor bronze wrap wire boast a dynamic balance of rich, full-bodied tone and sparkling high-end clarity. Compared to our original POLYWEB Coating, the ultra-thin NANOWEB Coating allows a more traditionally textured, “uncoated” feel. For a slicker, gentler feel, try a set of strings with our original POLYWEB Coating. The 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings with POLYWEB Coating, for example, might be a good fit if you want a more robust and rounded tone. On the other end of the tone spectrum, our 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings with NANOWEB Coating deliver a brighter, crisper tone alongside the same traditional feel as these phosphor bronze strings. Of course, the kind of string you play is all a matter of personal preference. Not sure what tone or feel is right for you? Try them out for yourself, and find your new favorite string from Elixir Strings. For a more in-depth look at what makes our strings so special, scroll to the branded info further down the page.

The D'Addario/Planet Waves NS Capo line offers multiple innovative and easy to use options that fit a wide array of instruments and player preferences.

The NS Capo Pro is constructed from aircraft grade aluminum making it rugged enough to take a beating, but keeping it very lightweight on the fretboard. Equipped with a patented micrometer for tension adjustment, the NS Capo can be dialed in to ensure the proper force is being applied to the neck of the guitar. This feature makes dealing with buzzing notes and tuning issues a thing of the past. The NS Capo Pro is ideal for use on 6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars.

The NS Capo Lite uses a durable molded ABS thermoplastic construction to offer the most lightweight and cost effective choice. Ideal for use on all acoustic and electric 6 string guitars the NS Capo Lite can be adjusted to provide the exact tension need for your guitar. Designed for guitars with radiused fretboards, the NS Capo Lite greatly reduces the need to retune after applying your capo.

The NS Classical Guitar Capo, the third option within the NS Capo line, takes the design elements of the NS Capo Pro and tailors them to fit the needs of classical guitarists. With a contoured design and a flat radius intended specifically for the wider fretboard found on most classical guitars, the NS Classical Guitar Capo delivers the sleek construction and single handed operation of the NS design.

The importance of being able to play and stay in tune cannot be understated. With this in mind, the NS Capo design was crafted to allow every player to refine the tension the capo applies to their fretboard. This not only assures buzz-free clarity across all strings, but keeps strings from being pulled sharp by over-tensioning. In the long run this can also benefit the maintenance of your fretboard and save on upkeep.

Another difference between condenser and dynamic mics is that they contain active circuitry that requires phantom power (+48 V DC) for operation. You can power them from any phantom power equipped BEHRINGER XENYX mixer, plus enjoy the benefits of our state-of-the-art XENYX mic preamps.

Why the C-1?
The C-1 is an affordable, high-quality way to put this essential studio tool to work for you. Thanks to its cardioid (heart-shaped) pattern, the C-1 microphone picks up your source signal while rejecting off-axis sounds that can ruin an otherwise perfect recording. With its pressure-gradient, shock-mounted transducer and gold-plated XLR output, the C-1 is very neutral sounding and truly delivers on the promise of noise-free transmission.

With its exceptionally flat frequency response and ultra-high sound resolution, it's perfect for perfect for acoustic instruments, overhead, piano, and plenty more.

Built to Last
The C-1 is built to be your go-to condenser mic for years to come. Its tough, die-cast body can withstand all the rigors of bleary-eyed late-night recording marathons. And with its rugged foam-padded carrying case, it travels in safety and style. We also included a swivel stand mount so it can be affixed to your studio's mic stands.

2 Matched Studio Condenser Microphones

Our C-2 microphones are built to capture the performance of a choir, piano or any other vocal or acoustic sound source to provide a beautiful true-to-life sound. Sold in perfectly matched pairs, these condenser mics are outstanding in both live and studio applications.

A condenser mic is the ideal choice for capturing vocals or acoustic instruments, either in live or recording settings. By their very nature, condenser microphones are much more sensitive than dynamic microphones, enabling them to pick-up even the subtlest of signals. Thanks to their cardioid (heart-shaped) pattern, C-2 microphones pick up your source signal while rejecting off-axis sounds that can ruin an otherwise perfect recording.

Another difference between condenser and dynamic mics is they contain active circuitry that requires phantom power (+48 V DC) for operation. You can power them from any phantom power equipped BEHRINGER XENYX mixer, plus enjoy the benefits of our state-of-the-art XENYX mic preamps.

Every stitch of these mics is designed to deliver beautiful sound. Beginning with the gold-plated 3-pin XLR connector, you get the highest signal integrity.

Once connected to your system, you'll notice these twin pro-caliber microphones have a 4 dB boost in the 1 kHz - 8 kHz range. For those of you new to condenser mics, this basically means you'll get a slightly brighter sound that will give the perfect shape to cymbals and overhead miking. Acoustic pianos and choirs also benefit greatly from this type of frequency response.

The cardioid pickup pattern provides unparalleled sound source separation and feedback rejection. C-2 mics contain ultra low-noise transformerless FET input circuitry that can handle extreme dynamics with a maximum sound pressure level of 136 dB. So even if the featured performer at your next recording session or live show happens to be a revved-up jet engine, this workhorse mic will not distort!

Our C-2 mics also feature a low-frequency rolloff switch to eliminate infrasonics (mic handling noise, sound created by creaky stages), as well as a switchable -10 dB input pad to accommodate hot signals, such as a really loud vocalist or overzealous cellist.

The C-2 mics not only sound great, they come packed with custom stand adapters, windscreens, a stereo bar for mounting both mics in stereo alignment, and a transport case. As soon as you take them out of the box, these mics are ready to become a mind-blowing addition to your sound arsenal. Check them out at a BEHRINGER dealer near you.

Ultra Low-Noise 4-Channel Line Mixer

Despite its ultra-compact size, this 4-channel line mixer is big on features! It yields the highest sonic quality at all output levels, boasting ultra low-noise 4580 operational amplifiers for outstanding audio performance - the same op amps found in its much bigger brethren. Expanding on the capabilities of standard-size mixers is where the MX400 does extremely well, for example as a sub-mixer. If you are running short on available channels on your ""big"" mixer and need to bring the output of three different keyboards into your mix, you can simply connect them to the MX400, work out the keyboard mix, and connect the MX400's output to a single input on your main mixer.

It will catch your eye because it's cute as a button, but you'll want to own one because of what it can do for your performance.

380,"Finding it hard to get the perfect sound from your guitar? Maybe your guitar gets lost in the mix? Do you have major feedback issues with your acoustic? The problem's not your guitar-you need an equalizer! You can instantly improve the sound of your guitar with a little help from the EQ700.Most performers don't have a clue about what good equalization can do for their sound. Maybe you've heard the old maxim, ""Make a sine-wave to get really good sound,"" or ""Make a smiley-face, that always works."" Sadly, this qualifies as advice from the uninformed. Just as every room is unique, so is every musical instrument. Even guitars made by the same manufacturer, using the same materials, on the same day can vary a great deal.People provide a good example of this principal-although we are all similar, we don't all wear the same size shoes, or even have the same color eyes. There is no one ""perfect"" equalization curve that fits every scenario; equalization is dynamic.Most acoustic and electric guitar energy lies between 100 Hz and 6.4 kHz. Even slight changes in this range can cause a tremendous variation in overall energy and impact, as the human ear is especially sensitive to this range.Boosting frequencies around 200 Hz - 400 Hz often provides warmth and body, while boosting frequencies in the 3.2 kHz - 6.4 kHz range adds clarity to clean guitar signals. Depending on the amount of distortion, this same range can ruin the sound of an overdriven electric guitar by adding harsh harmonics.One of the most common mistakes is adding too much bass to acoustic guitars. If the low frequencies are boosted excessively, acoustics can easily get lost in the overall mix. Most acoustic guitars are also prone to feedback in the 200 Hz - 400 Hz range.A general rule of thumb-the best results are often achieved by finding and reducing the frequency bands that are offending, and then turning up the overall volume, rather than boosting on

Your strings matter. D'Addario's Phosphor Bronze acoustic guitar strings are engineered to serve as the critical link between you and your guitar. Our most popular acoustic guitar strings, EJ's are precision wound with corrosion resistant Phosphor Bronze onto a carefully drawn, hexagonally shaped, high carbon steel core. The result is long lasting, bright sounding tone with excellent intonation.

Three components of a D'Addario guitar string work together to create your desired tone: Hex-core, outer wrap wire, and ball-end. It all starts with the core. D'Addario pioneered the use of the Hex Core, and as the name suggests, it is a six-sided high carbon steel core-wire. Each side ""bites"" into the wire used for the outer winding, creating a tight and consistent bond that keeps the string in tune from end to end. The final component is a D'Addario exclusive: color-coded ball-ends that secure the string in place at the guitar's bridge, allowing for easy string identification and a major reduction in wasteful packaging.

92% copper and 8% tin with phosphorous, introduced to string making by D'Addario in 1974 as the first ""extended life"" strings. Phosphor Bronze is synonymous with warm, bright, and well balanced acoustic tone.

The most popular and universal construction, Round Wound strings deliver the traditional textured feel most players are familiar and comfortable with.

Ideal for the widest variety of guitars and musical styles, D'Addario acoustic strings are the choice of countless professionals around the world including Dave Matthews, Sheryl Crow, Keith Urban, Blake Shelton, Ryan Adams, and many more!

It all starts with our exclusively engineered and built string winding machines. There is literally nothing like a D'Addario string machine. The combination of the most advanced computer-controlled winding technology and stringent incoming wire inspection delivers unmatched consistency, string after string, set after set. Our passion for and commitment to environmentally responsible packaging and raw materials fuels our continued innovation. Last but not least, every D'Addario string is made in the USA, ensuring the highest quality and performance.

416,"The Pure Mini is a transducer-only system. No battery, no onboard electronics, just the pure pickups. Don't be fooled by the sound of some competitors' ""thin sounding"" passive systems. The Pure Systems are definitely different. They sound full and rich and have sufficient output to drive most amps and PA systems directly, without a preamp! Advantages of the Pure Guitar System The special Pure surface transducers transmit a significant portion of the soundboard because they are not as close to the strings as an under-saddle pickup. Each of the 3 transducers is designed to pick up a specific string pair, but also ""listens"" to the adjacent area around the bridge. The Pure pickups are not under pressure and therefore do NOT sound percussive or harsh. The Pure System reproduces all strings nicely balanced, a known problem with under-saddle pickups. The Pure System sounds great just in passive mode! Unlike under-saddle pickups which passively can sound thin and trebley, the passive PURE system puts out a nicely balanced, warm, full range signal. Feedback Resistance How safe is the Pure System with feedback? Due to the Pure System's location on the bridge plate under the bridge, feedback resistance is comparable to under-saddle transducers. Technically, a pickup installed in or on the bridge is a lot less likely to feedback than one which is attached to the open sound board. The 1/8"" thin sound board can act like a diaphragm and vibrate along with loud sound-signals from speaker cabinets. This is the kind of feedback you experience on an acoustic guitar. The thicker bridge area is a lot harder to be set into vibration from an outside source simply because of its mass. In our tests with both, steel string and classic guitars equipped with an under-saddle pickup plus the Pure System, we were able to achieve about the same gain-before-feedback with both systems.

Classic Vibrato Effects Pedal

Kicking the ULTRA VIBRATO UV300 into action is like putting an invisible, automatic whammy bar on your guitar. From the gentle, pulsing rhythms of the ocean surf, to the wild, whirling effects of a rotating speaker system, the UV300 will bring a dose of days-gone-by to your sound.

Rotary speakers were most commonly associated with keyboards and organs when first introduced. But eager guitarists soon wanted to harness this soulful, lively sound for their own purposes.

With its Real Sound Modeling technology, this stomp box goes beyond approximation for a sound that will have your audience wondering where you're hiding your spinning speakers!

Heavy Metal Distortion Effects Pedal

In the churning, smoldering world of heavy metal, it's the middle frequencies that make the difference between mush and muscle. With the UM300 ULTRA METAL, you not only get take control of the Mids, you micromanage them!

The UM300 effects pedal gives you the most extreme, sought-after hard rock and heavy metal sounds with super-thick, tube-like distortion - plus virtually endless sustain.

Like most distortion stomp boxes, the UM300 comes with DISTORTION and LEVEL controls. And the HIGH and LOW controls let you dial in the amount of top-end and bottom you desire. But the similarity to other stomps ends right there. Much like our world-class mixing consoles, we've given the UM300 a MID FREQ control, allowing you to select a midrange frequency (from 200 Hz to 5 kHz) and boost/cut it by up to 15 dB (that's a lot!). What this means, in terms of tone, is thick, tube-like distortion with endless sustain, for everything from aggressive, traditional metal assaults to bone-crunching mayhem.

A bright blue LED tells you when the UM300 is active, while a top-quality on/off switch maintains highest signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power the UM300 with our PSU-SB DC power supply (not included), or pop in a 9 V battery.

Is there a hole in the middle of your tone? You'll be surprised how affordably and efficiently the ULTRA METAL UM300 can fill that void. See your BEHRINGER dealer today.

Ultimate Guitar/Bass Tuner

For the gigging guitarist or bassist, the CHROMATIC TUNER TU300 is an absolutely essential piece of gear that goes above and beyond the capabilities of ordinary tuners.

Most guitarists and bassists tune to standard tuning: (low to high) E, A, D, G, B, E for guitar and E, A, D, G for bass. Still others like to detune their instruments for access to lower notes and increased string flexibility. No matter what you prefer, the TU300 can accommodate. That's because this crucial stomp box gives you three guitar modes (regular, flat, double flat), three bass modes (regular, flat, double flat) and a chromatic setting. Whether you stay in standard tuning, detune, or tune to an exotic tuning of your own design, the TU300 will get you there quickly and accurately.

To begin tuning, simply stomp the TU300's footswitch. It features a precise single-digit LED display to tell you what note it's reading, and the 11-point stream guarantees accurate tuning from 438 Hz to 447 Hz. Plus it is bright enough to help you tune up in even the darkest club. The main OUT allows you to cut the signal to your amp while you tune, or you can send a constant signal from the BYPASS output. The status LED tells you when this box is activated and the solid electronic on/off switch maintains incredible signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power this pedal with a 9 V battery or a DC power supply.

Along with standard Volume, Drive, and Tone controls, the OCD V2's HP/LP (High Peak/Low Peak) switch takes the pedal from a clean boost to manic, sustain-laden distortion. True bypass switching. Some notable V2 updates to the classic OCD: -Output buffer (when pedal is turned on in True-Bypass mode, or always when in Enhanced Bypass mode), which eliminates it from being influenced by effects that came after it. Translation: Your sound remains consistent regardless of placement in today’s more complex signal-chains, loopers and pedalboards. This buffer also had a positive effect on the sound, it reduced loading on the pedal’s hard-clipping stage, allowing more sustain of both the sound and the overtones. -Class A configured discrete 2N5457 JFET input section, raising the input impedance to 1 mega ohms (previously 330K) and increasing the dynamics.

Classic Dynamics Compressor

Compression gives strong presence and snappy attitude to your clean sound while making your leads absolutely scream. The DC9 gives you an incredible compressed sound in one tough, easy-to-use stomp box.

Dynamics play an important role in music. They help to convey emotion, whether it's a sultry blues solo or the unrelenting gallop of unfettered metal. But uncontrolled dynamics can take all your best intentions and turn them into so much, well..mush. That's where compression comes in, softening loud sounds and boosting low signal levels to keep everything more uniform. So, a compressor's main job is to make every note the same volume.

Ever notice how some strings on your guitar or bass sound louder than others? This is partly due to physics. Strings with lower mass just don't put out as much volume as the heavier ones. When used properly, a compressor makes all of the strings the same volume. Compressors are also great for slap-style bass players, making thumb slaps, string pulls and muted notes all the same volume, for an extremely percussive effect.

Just twist the dedicated Output dial to determine how much volume you want it to kick out, then adjust the Sensitivity dial to determine the level where everything from delicate strumming to aggressive picking will be heard with equal presence. Whether you're ready to tear up the countryside with some down-home chicken-pickin' or melt faces with a searing metal solo, the DC9 will change your idea of ideal tone. The blue status LED tells you when the DC9 is on, while the true hardware on/off switch maintains the highest quality signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power it with a 9 V battery or a DC power supply (not included).

When your music is too good to be ignored, play it through the Dynamics Compressor DC9. Your sound will be impossible to miss!

Digital Stereo Delay/Echo Effects Pedal

The BEHRINGER DD400 has an obsession with the past - the last 1.3 seconds of it, to be exact.

Delay is a synthetic echo that, in adjustable increments, repeats the notes you play on guitar. Each repeated tone becomes quieter than the previous one, until the repeats are no longer heard. This results in a thick, robust sound that can take on everything from the quick ""slap"" echo of classic rockabilly to the long, dreamy echoes found in psychedelic rock.

This box will sing the fading, ghostly praises of every note you squeeze from your axe. With seven modes of delay to choose from, there is a vast pallete of echoes to explore with the DD400. Take advantage of its full 1.3-second memory or scale it back for a more abrupt echo. Just twist the dedicated Mode, Time, Feedback and Level controls to create the delay of your dreams. There is also a HOLD mode that allows you to loop a brief riff, then play over it. The blue LED tells you when it's on, and the first-class on/off switch maintains incredible signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power the DD400 with a 9 V battery or a DC power adapter.

Giving your sound a transcendental twist has never sounded better, or been more affordable! When it's atmosphere your guitar craves, put the DD400 to work for you.

489,"For the player who needs a large pedalboard without the extra bulk (or expense) of a flight case. A heavy duty cordura nylon gig bag is included with solid panels sewn inside the walls for added strength, plus a large and roomy gusseted pouch on the exterior.

Pedaltrain is the premier innovation in guitar effects pedalboards. Our award winning and patented design has been road tested, approved, and is currently in use by many of today's top guitarists. Professional tour grade pedalboards and cases at prices everyone can afford.

Construction
These revolutionary pedalboards are made of welded aluminum alloy tubing to ensure that every PEDALTRAIN is as strong and lightweight as possible. There are no moving parts to loosen or wear out. A durable powder coat finish ensures your PEDALTRAIN will look great and last a lifetime.

Versatile Design
Our unique, open frame, elevated angle design provides added flexibility when configuring the layout of the effects. Your connecting cables can be neatly routed over, under, and through the open slots in the top surface area of the PEDALTRAIN to keep the risk of possible accidental disconnection to a minimum. Pedals may be added, removed, rearranged, or bypassed quickly and easily. All three PEDALTRAIN models include plenty of industrial grade, adhesive backed, hook and loop material, along with detailed instructions to make setup fast and efficient. You can easily and securely mount virtually any effects pedal, volume or wah pedal, or other device, such as a pedal power supply, channel switcher, power strip, direct box, or wireless receiver.

All new PEDALTRAIN models (excluding PT-MINI) now include specially designed brackets and instructions for mounting the popular Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 power supply underneath the pedalboard with no cutting modifications necessary. As always, you can still use any power supply of your choice with the PEDALTRAIN.



Frequently Asked Questions
1. Where's the power supply?
The power supply question is a good one, and it is the reason that the pedaltrain will always be available non-powered. There are as many ideas about what's the best way to power up your effects as there are guitar players. The best power supplies currently available do not come with a pedalboard. All the units described below work great with the pedaltrain, and until we make our own that will do everything, for everyone, at a price anyone can afford we will continue to recommend the following:



There are many others out there but these are units we've had actual experiences with. All have different features and prices so take your time and pick the one that suits your needs and not necessarily what someone says is the ""best"".

2. Can I mount a power supply underneath?
Yes, all new Pedaltrain models (excluding PT-MINI) will accommodate most any power supply available underneath with little or no modifications necessary.

3. What is the best order to put my effects in?
This is a huge question. We do have a few suggestions but ultimately it depends on how your particular collection of pedals all interact with each other. In our experience there are no formulas that haven't been disproved a time or two. Our philosophy is simple: Effects pedals are like children, some of them get along fine sitting next to each other and some do not. Any one of them may potentially be the problem child that disrupts the whole classroom if not put in the right place. The best way to start would be to lay all of the pedals out on the floor and first do a straight line patching of them together and powering them up with what you intend to use for power on your pedalboard. Then play, stomp, and listen. Don't be in a rush, the time you invest will pay off in satisfying tone. We've seen people insist on a certain order because someone told them ""this is how it's done"" only to have their tone suffer needlessly. Nothing will substitute blocking out a few hours of jockeying them all around in the chain to find the most quiet and tone pleasing order before you ever mount them to a pedalboard. Then write everything down! Keep in mind that you selection of pedals is unique to only you and what works great for one person may be horrible for the next.

Once you have everything all running as clean and quiet as possible then you can start to mount them. Occasionally you may need to mount them in an order that suits you foot stomping order than in signal path order. If that is the case you simply patch them together in the order they need to be, but mount them where it is the most comfortable. Are you confused yet? I hope not, good luck!

4. Does everything stay mounted on the pedaltrain while inside the case?
Yes, the pedaltrain case is designed with ample interior room to hold the fully loaded pedaltrain. You should not have to remove anything during storage or transport. Everything fits nicely and will be in place when you get to the gig. There is a 2.5 inch thick layer of egg crate type foam in the lid to conform to the shape and height of your set up.

5. Does the Velcro really hold the pedals in position while being transported?
Yes, and for a few reasons. One is that with the open frame design you will have at least two attachment points for each pedals and two separate velcro connections. This actually holds things in place much better than if it was one big surface area with one wide strip. Also we are very picky when it comes to velcro and we use the best and stickiest stuff you can get. Folks keep asking us to just sell velcro to them.

With the hard cases another feature is that helps keep things in place is that we actually leave a little bit of room around the board inside the case to absorb some of the shock if your case has a rough ride in a truck or bus. When a pedalboard is built rigidly into a case (as many are) they do not consider the fact that the shock has to go somewhere and it usually means pedals coming loose from the board. This took me years of frustration to figure out I was looking at the wrong thing as being the problem. We also have a thick 2 inch layer of eggcrate foam in the lid that conforms to the shape of all your pedals and helps keep things firmly in place too.

6. My Pedaltrain case has too much space around the board, why?
In the flight cases of the Pedaltrain/JR and Pedaltrain/2 we added extra space to allow you to carry other things inside along with a fully loaded pedaltrain. Many folks who use large volume and wah pedals actually prefer to use them flat on the floor next to their pedaltrain and just patch them into their signal path with a small patch cable. So we have enough space to lay them inside the case too. You will also have room for all your cables, cords, tool bag, boxes of strings, dirty socks, etc...

The amount of extra width space is by design and serves a purpose. One of the main problems with pedalboards that are built into a case, or one with a tightly fitting board, is that when the case takes a hit or is dropped during transport, whatever is mounted to that case or board (your pedals) is what receives the force of that shock. This is the primary reason that pedals come disconnected from boards during transport. The pedaltrain case affords the pedalboard frame the ability to move inside the case to act as a shock absorber. This may sound crazy but it actually works.

We guarantee that if you choose a pedaltrain, and ever open the case to find your pedals have come off the board, we will buy back your pedaltrain at your purchase price. We're proud to state that in 9 years no one has taken us up on this offer.

7. What should I do about rubber feet or pads on the bottom of my pedals?
Take them off. To insure proper adhesion of the velcro to the bottom of your pedals it is best to stick the velcro directly to the metal bottom. It's OK if it's painted, but you will need to get any old adhesive residue off before applying the velcro to a clean and dry surface. This is especially true of Boss and Line6 brand pedals. Those rubber pads will require some effort to get off, but the end result is well worth it. Also, if your pedal board is exposed to extreme heat (like a car trunk in August) the adhesive compound on the velcro breaks down and rejects the bond if it's applied to a rubber pad.

For pedals with rubber feet that actually hold on the bottom plate of the effect, such as a Crybaby wah, You will need to remove the rubber feet and reinstall the screws. On some the housings on pedals of this type the holes will be tapped deep enough to do this. If the original screws will not go all the way in you'll need to go down to the hardware store and get some shorter screws of the same thread type to hold your plate on. If all this makes you stomach hurt just thinking about it, a company called Stompin-Ground sells a flat mounting plate to fit most popular wah pedals for $19.00 with velcro already attached. Check it out. http://stompin-ground.com/products/sgwahplate.htm

8. What if I need to get some more velcro?

The D'Addario/Planet Waves NS Capo line offers multiple innovative and easy to use options that fit a wide array of instruments and player preferences.

The NS Capo Pro is constructed from aircraft grade aluminum making it rugged enough to take a beating, but keeping it very lightweight on the fretboard. Equipped with a patented micrometer for tension adjustment, the NS Capo can be dialed in to ensure the proper force is being applied to the neck of the guitar. This feature makes dealing with buzzing notes and tuning issues a thing of the past. The NS Capo Pro is ideal for use on 6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars.

The NS Capo Lite uses a durable molded ABS thermoplastic construction to offer the most lightweight and cost effective choice. Ideal for use on all acoustic and electric 6 string guitars the NS Capo Lite can be adjusted to provide the exact tension need for your guitar. Designed for guitars with radiused fretboards, the NS Capo Lite greatly reduces the need to retune after applying your capo.

The NS Classical Guitar Capo, the third option within the NS Capo line, takes the design elements of the NS Capo Pro and tailors them to fit the needs of classical guitarists. With a contoured design and a flat radius intended specifically for the wider fretboard found on most classical guitars, the NS Classical Guitar Capo delivers the sleek construction and single handed operation of the NS design.

The importance of being able to play and stay in tune cannot be understated. With this in mind, the NS Capo design was crafted to allow every player to refine the tension the capo applies to their fretboard. This not only assures buzz-free clarity across all strings, but keeps strings from being pulled sharp by over-tensioning. In the long run this can also benefit the maintenance of your fretboard and save on upkeep.

Deluxe Edition
The Studiophile BX5a Deluxe monitors update the best-selling M-Audio BX5a system with a variety of enhancements. The updated waveguide delivers excellent imaging. A new low-frequency transducer provides well-defined bass. Custom amplifier tuning enhances the integration between the high and low frequencies, delivering refined spectral balance and a smoother response. An elegant new industrial design completes the package.

Kevlar Drivers
M-Audio's Studiophile BX5a Deluxe monitors employ Kevlar for low-frequency driver construction. Kevlar's high mechanical and thermal resilience makes it ideal for use in speaker cones. Our engineers also created a curved conical design that improves room dispersion. High-damping reliable rubber surrounds provide percussive musical bass, and also insure that the cone reaches its optimal excursion for accurate reproduction.

Silk-Dome, Waveguide-Loaded, High-Frequency Drivers
Our high-frequency domes are made from natural silk to counter the high Q ringing that's inherent in the poorly crafted metallic materials commonly found in other monitors. In addition, our new waveguides refine the high-frequency response. M-Audio's FerroFlow technology uses ferrofluid liquid cooling to dissipate heat for maximum efficiency and extended usage.

Bi-Amplified Efficiency
Active monitors have a distinct advantage over unpowered monitors because the built-in power amps are designed to work with the drivers and crossovers in a tuned system. Bi-amplification further refines the concept by dedicating separate power amps to the highs and lows. Combined with a finely tuned crossover, this design insures that both the high- and low-frequency drivers are asked to deliver only the frequencies they are most efficient at reproducing.

Rear-Ported Cabinet Design
The BX5a Deluxe monitor's cabinet is integrally designed with its other components for optimal performance--right down to rounded corners for reduced edge diffraction and superior imaging. Custom rear-port design audibly reduces the turbulence and resulting distortion caused by poorly designed ports.

Magnetically Shielded for Desktop Use
Unchecked, the electromagnetic waves emanating from your speakers can wreak havoc with your computer's video monitor or a nearby TV. The Studiophile BX5a Deluxe monitors are magnetically shielded so all of your electronic equipment can coexist on your desktop without interference.

Ultimate Pitch Shifter / Harmonist Effects Pedal

Using the US600 ULTRA SHIFTER/HARMONIST is like having another guitar player in your band. Shift single notes and chords to create simple transpositions, intelligent harmonies and radical bends up to ±2 octaves.

Tremolo bars add a handsome shimmer to your guitar sound by detuning your strings and then returning them to pitch. And the sound of two guitars playing in harmony adds a soaring, heroic touch to an ordinary lead. The US600 is built to take the place of a tremolo bar AND a second guitarist. Its Real Sound Modeling (RSM) technology produces sophisticated algorithms that deliver the delicate harmonic overtones that are critical to creating realistic harmonies and transpositions.

The US600 stomp box offers 5 totally different-sounding Modes: Tremolo Bar, Flutter, Detune, Harmonist and Pitch Shifter. Pitch Shift and Tremolo Bar pitch can be shifted from 0 to 2 octaves; Harmonist pitch can be tweaked to track 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, 6ths, octaves or double octaves. There's a separate 10-step Key select control as well as Delay/Speed control and Balance to dial in how much effect you want to mix with a dry signal. A brilliant blue LED indicates power status and battery condition. The footswitch is ultra-strong to last through years of gigging. And in bypass mode, it preserves signal integrity by taking all pedal circuitry out of your chain. The US600 pedal is designed to give you the utmost flexibility, running on our BEHRINGER PSU-SB DC power supply or a typical 9 V battery.

Plug into the US600 and take your guitar places it has never been. Now even a solitary guitarist whose axe sports a steadfast bridge can harness the power of harmony and tremolo!

Ultimate Echo Modeling Effects Pedal

Delay comes in many different flavors. The BEHRINGER EM600 gives you access to a vast palette of delays all in one amazing stomp box.

Delay is a synthetic echo that, in adjustable increments, repeats the notes you play on guitar. Each repeated tone becomes quieter than the previous one, until the repeats are no longer heard. This results in a thick, robust sound that can take on everything from the quick ""engines"" echo of classic rockabilly to the long, dreamy echoes found in psychedelic rock.

The Echo Machine is essentially 11 delays in one pedal: Ping Pong, Reverse, two different multi-delays, Tracking, Sweep, Swirl, Slap and three different tap modes. BEHRINGER Real Sound Modeling technology gives this pedal the ability to emulate the acoustics of a variety of environments. Produce realistic cathedral-like echo in your bedroom or cave-like echo at the corner bar. Real Sound Modeling makes it possible!

You can choose to give the effect a digital, analog or tape delay feel via a dedicated switch. You can also choose to put lush, psychedelic tails behind every note you play, or a more abrupt delay that fades quickly. Sculpt it into a truly unique delay by twisting the dedicated Mix, Time, Repeat and Modulation dials. There's even a Tap function that allows you to dial in the delay tempo by rhythmically tapping the footswitch. You can power this stompbox with a 9 V battery or a DC Power Supply (not included).

If you're gonzo for echo, the EM600 has the sonic palette to keep you delayed again and again.

This unique new device fits snugly over HardWire knobs to protect your finely-tuned settings from the drops, bumps and kicks that inevitably take place when you and your pedal perform.

Your guitar and amp are the foundation of your tone. You need to make sure that when you add any pedal to your signal chain it’s not creating undesirable noise or coloring the unique character of your tone. In a true bypass pedal, the signal passes straight through the box when the effect is bypassed.

Fumbling on a dimly-lit stage for the right pedal is a thing of the past with this indispensable asset—now your HardWire pedal will be clearly in sight from dusk till dawn.

Battery-powered effects typically perform their best with a fresh battery. As the voltage of the battery decreases, effects can become gritty and distorted. With HardWire pedals, the same circuitry that boosts the voltage also keeps it constant throughout the life of the battery.

All HardWire pedals include both die cut a velcro mounting pad for mounting on a pedalboard and an anti-skid pad for use on the floor. The soft durometer anti-skid pad with high visco-elasticity and a unique tread design ensures a firm grip to any stage.

With the high-output pickups found on some electric guitars, it’s not unusual to hear clipping when playing through an effects pedal. This occurs when the voltage range produced by a guitar’s pickup is greater than the operating voltage of the effects pedal – normally limited to the voltage supplied by the pedal’s battery or power supply. HardWire pedals incorporate special circuitry that increases the operating voltage “headroom” above that of the typical pedal. As such, HardWire pedals benefit a wider range of guitars and are also at home in an amplifier’s effects loop.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. Where's the power supply?
The power supply question is a good one, and it is the reason that the pedaltrain will always be available non-powered. There are as many ideas about what's the best way to power up your effects as there are guitar players. The best power supplies currently available do not come with a pedalboard. All the units described below work great with the pedaltrain, and until we make our own that will do everything, for everyone, at a price anyone can afford we will continue to recommend the following:



There are many others out there but these are units we've had actual experiences with. All have different features and prices so take your time and pick the one that suits your needs and not necessarily what someone says is the ""best"".

2. Can I mount a power supply underneath?
Yes, all new Pedaltrain models (excluding PT-MINI) will accommodate most any power supply available underneath with little or no modifications necessary.

3. What is the best order to put my effects in?
This is a huge question. We do have a few suggestions but ultimately it depends on how your particular collection of pedals all interact with each other. In our experience there are no formulas that haven't been disproved a time or two. Our philosophy is simple: Effects pedals are like children, some of them get along fine sitting next to each other and some do not. Any one of them may potentially be the problem child that disrupts the whole classroom if not put in the right place. The best way to start would be to lay all of the pedals out on the floor and first do a straight line patching of them together and powering them up with what you intend to use for power on your pedalboard. Then play, stomp, and listen. Don't be in a rush, the time you invest will pay off in satisfying tone. We've seen people insist on a certain order because someone told them ""this is how it's done"" only to have their tone suffer needlessly. Nothing will substitute blocking out a few hours of jockeying them all around in the chain to find the most quiet and tone pleasing order before you ever mount them to a pedalboard. Then write everything down! Keep in mind that you selection of pedals is unique to only you and what works great for one person may be horrible for the next.

Once you have everything all running as clean and quiet as possible then you can start to mount them. Occasionally you may need to mount them in an order that suits you foot stomping order than in signal path order. If that is the case you simply patch them together in the order they need to be, but mount them where it is the most comfortable. Are you confused yet? I hope not, good luck!

4. Does everything stay mounted on the pedaltrain while inside the case?
Yes, the pedaltrain case is designed with ample interior room to hold the fully loaded pedaltrain. You should not have to remove anything during storage or transport. Everything fits nicely and will be in place when you get to the gig. There is a 2.5 inch thick layer of egg crate type foam in the lid to conform to the shape and height of your set up.

5. Does the Velcro really hold the pedals in position while being transported?
Yes, and for a few reasons. One is that with the open frame design you will have at least two attachment points for each pedals and two separate velcro connections. This actually holds things in place much better than if it was one big surface area with one wide strip. Also we are very picky when it comes to velcro and we use the best and stickiest stuff you can get. Folks keep asking us to just sell velcro to them.

With the hard cases another feature is that helps keep things in place is that we actually leave a little bit of room around the board inside the case to absorb some of the shock if your case has a rough ride in a truck or bus. When a pedalboard is built rigidly into a case (as many are) they do not consider the fact that the shock has to go somewhere and it usually means pedals coming loose from the board. This took me years of frustration to figure out I was looking at the wrong thing as being the problem. We also have a thick 2 inch layer of eggcrate foam in the lid that conforms to the shape of all your pedals and helps keep things firmly in place too.

6. My Pedaltrain case has too much space around the board, why?
In the flight cases of the Pedaltrain/JR and Pedaltrain/2 we added extra space to allow you to carry other things inside along with a fully loaded pedaltrain. Many folks who use large volume and wah pedals actually prefer to use them flat on the floor next to their pedaltrain and just patch them into their signal path with a small patch cable. So we have enough space to lay them inside the case too. You will also have room for all your cables, cords, tool bag, boxes of strings, dirty socks, etc...

The amount of extra width space is by design and serves a purpose. One of the main problems with pedalboards that are built into a case, or one with a tightly fitting board, is that when the case takes a hit or is dropped during transport, whatever is mounted to that case or board (your pedals) is what receives the force of that shock. This is the primary reason that pedals come disconnected from boards during transport. The pedaltrain case affords the pedalboard frame the ability to move inside the case to act as a shock absorber. This may sound crazy but it actually works.

We guarantee that if you choose a pedaltrain, and ever open the case to find your pedals have come off the board, we will buy back your pedaltrain at your purchase price. We're proud to state that in 9 years no one has taken us up on this offer.

7. What should I do about rubber feet or pads on the bottom of my pedals?
Take them off. To insure proper adhesion of the velcro to the bottom of your pedals it is best to stick the velcro directly to the metal bottom. It's OK if it's painted, but you will need to get any old adhesive residue off before applying the velcro to a clean and dry surface. This is especially true of Boss and Line6 brand pedals. Those rubber pads will require some effort to get off, but the end result is well worth it. Also, if your pedal board is exposed to extreme heat (like a car trunk in August) the adhesive compound on the velcro breaks down and rejects the bond if it's applied to a rubber pad.

For pedals with rubber feet that actually hold on the bottom plate of the effect, such as a Crybaby wah, You will need to remove the rubber feet and reinstall the screws. On some the housings on pedals of this type the holes will be tapped deep enough to do this. If the original screws will not go all the way in you'll need to go down to the hardware store and get some shorter screws of the same thread type to hold your plate on. If all this makes you stomach hurt just thinking about it, a company called Stompin-Ground sells a flat mounting plate to fit most popular wah pedals for $19.00 with velcro already attached. Check it out. http://stompin-ground.com/products/sgwahplate.htm

8. What if I need to get some more velcro?
We do keep a limited supply on hand available for Pedaltrain owners. Please contact us for details.

9. What is the Pedaltrain warranty?
All Pedaltrain products carry a lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. This warranty does not cover incidental or consequential damage to persons or property caused by use, abuse, misuse, or improper storage or transport of the unit.

This warranty shall not apply to any goods that have been altered or modified by anyone other than ProStageGear. This warranty is valid to the original purchase only and not transferable.

One of the original models of the Iberia series, the C5 is a full size acoustic nylon-string guitar with a solid Canadian cedar top, mahogany back and sides, and a rosewood fingerboard. Handmade in the traditional Spanish style, the C5 also features an all wood inlaid rosette, rosewood binding, hand-carved headstock, fan bracing system, and bone nut and saddle.

The best-selling C5 is a lightweight, full-size nylon string guitar built in the Spanish classical tradition. The combination of the solid cedar top with mahogany back and sides gives the C5 a warm, round sound. Whether you're a classical player or simply shopping for a new acoustic guitar, you'll love the feel and tone of the Cordoba C5.

Nylon string guitars are built more lightly than steel string guitars, allowing the soundboard to vibrate and resonate more freely. The fan bracing pattern gives the center of the soundboard more surface area to vibrate, and respond to the tension of the strings. A more responsive soundboard makes the guitar louder, and provides better tone. Like all Cordoba guitars, the C5 comes equipped with a lightweight, two-way truss rod that allows you to adjust the amount of relief in the guitar's neck. A Cordoba deluxe gig bag is optional.

Solid Canadian cedar top, mahogany back and sides, rosewood fingerboard, bridge and binding, natural high gloss PU finish, 52mm nut width, 650mm scale length, Savarez Cristal Corum strings. Available in left-handed. Optional Cordoba Deluxe Gig Bag.

Iberia models range from half to full size, and feature solid Canadian cedar or solid European spruce tops with African mahogany, cypress, or Indian rosewood back and sides. The scope of the Iberia series is quite broad; whether you're browsing for a student model, traditional classical, traditional flamenco, or a stage-ready nylon string guitar with a cutaway and pickup, you'll find what you're looking for! These completely handmade guitars are lightweight, with a warm, resonant tone and comfortable playing action. All models include two-way truss rods.

Founded in 1997, Cordoba seeks to guide the evolution of the nylon string guitar, blending traditional craftsmanship of the early master luthiers with modern developments. Inspired by the organic beauty and honesty of acoustic instruments, every Cordoba is lightweight, responsive, and a direct descendant of the Spanish tradition. Cordoba continues to challenge the definition of the acoustic guitar without sacrificing the authenticity of its heritage.

This awesome pedal board makes hooking up six 2.5"" x 4.5"" pedals as easy as hooking up just one (of course, if you're using pedals that aren't 2.5"" x 4.5"", the snug foam padding can be cut to accommodate pedals of varying shapes). The PB600 includes 1/4"" patch cables, so you can leave your pedals connected to one another, ready to pass signal even when you're transporting them. It also comes with 1 x 6 daisy chain cabling so that when you plug in the 1.7 A power adapter, all your pedals receive power. Meanwhile, all cabling remains safe and free of strain. Failure is almost guaranteed when you're dealing with a rat's nest of loose cabling, but with the PB600, your effects chain is always safe and organized.

Connect your guitar, bass or keyboard to the single 1/4"" input in the upper right corner of the board. A pair of 1/4"" FROM EFFECTS jacks in the upper left corner allow you to connect stereo effects, and two 1/4"" OUTPUT TO AMP jacks send a left and right stereo signal to up to two amps.

When it's time to load out, just unplug the power supply, disconnect your guitar and amp, put the lid back on the PB600 and slide the locking latches back into place. The heavyimpact plastic casing will protect your pedals from the very worst dings, scrapes and scratches the road throws your way.

Dressed in classic two-tone vinyl, running on one power and one preamp valve and featuring bone-simple controls, the BUGERA V5 looks like a carefully constructed nostalgia trip. In fact, in many ways, it is! But plug into this beautiful little amp and you’ll not only find a sound that’s caked in real vintage raunch, but also modern features that take this sound to places it couldn’t go—until now.

Rock music brings to mind amplifiers as big as skyscrapers, dishing out irreversible ear damage at ruthless volumes. But a studio secret among guitar greats is that little low-watt valve combos like the V5 can be maxed out for red-hot overdriven tone without blowing fuses or incurring any property damage.

The V5 is a living, breathing homage to those half-pint screamers of the past, but with two very important improvements. See, this amp may be small, but 5 watts in Valvesville is still loud as hell when it’s sitting in your bedroom. That’s why the V5 features a switchable power attenuator that allows you to run 5, 1 or 0.1 Watts. An attenuator reduces the amplitude of a signal without changing its sound. That means you can still drive the valves into banshee-league fury, but without waking up the neighbors.

Finding a headphone out jack on an all-valve guitar amp is incredibly rare because the integration requires loading the output transformer and filtering the signal for a loudspeaker simulation. (Translation: it’s a pain in the ass!) But in true BUGERA fashion, we’ve gone the extra mile to allow you some late night practicing. Just plug in a pair of headphones to the 1/4"" phones jack on the back panel, and you’re ready to keep the V5’s all-valve sound all to yourself. Then again, if it’s more volume you need, the V5 has a 1/4"" Speaker Out jack that allows you to connect an additional speaker with a minimum impedance of 4 Ohms. This dangerous dandy also features the same studio-caliber digital reverb found in its bigger BUGERA brothers. The spring reverb found in the V5’s post-war predecessors sounds lovely, but is delicate and expensive to repair. The V5’s modern update gives you an equally mesmerizing vintage reverb sound without the wallet-draining vintage reliability.

With the V5 in your home or studio, your tonal woes are over. It bears the true sound of an antique 5W valve amp, it’s built to survive abuse, and its price tag is tons lighter than the ones you’ ll find tied to its elders. Adopt a V5 today and get ready to pack 60 years of sonic inspiration into your recording or practice sessions.

Since introducing the 505 pedal in 1996, Zoom compact multi-effect processors have been highly acclaimed by guitarists all over the world. Representing the next standard for expressive tone in any style, Zoom is pleased to introduce the all-new G1N.

The first thing you notice with the G1N is its totally new drive sounds that were developed using the state-of-the-art ZFX modeling technology. Featuring 15 amp and stomp-box models that faithfully replicate every detail of the classics, from gain settings to harmonic character, the G1N delivers natural expression from nuanced playing to total bone-sizzling shreds. And the new, original amp models designed especially by Zoom for the G1N will amaze.

It's never been easier to edit effects. Simply select the effect module with the selector knob then edit the value with the value knob. That's all there is to it. You can easily design your own tones to suit your music. Dedicated buttons for saving patches, a bank switcher and integrated rhythm patterns make fine-tuning your sounds a breeze. A chromatic tuner is available simply by stepping on the two pedal buttons simultaneously. And with bright LED indicators, you'll get easy operation even on a dark stage.

The G1N has 9 types of presets that simulate the sounds of rock legends like Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and many more. Plus, there are 21 types of artist patches designed by amazing guitar heroes like Michael Amott, Kiko Loureiro, Richie Kotzen, Rob Caggiano, Mike Stone and Matt Bachand, so you can use these professionally designed guitar sounds in your music. Also, there are 10 types of presets for any style of guitar playing, such as power chords, arpeggio, lead, cutting and much more. You can even save 40 patches you create in the G1N's user memory.

Replicating the high frequency overtones created by the distortion effect of tube amplifiers is made possible by Zoom's original 32-bit, ZFX-3 processor. This allows the frequency response for our G1N to extend to an amazing 20Hz through 40kHz with 96 kHz sampling rates. You get the rich harmonics of distortion specific to various types of tube amps, made possible with 24-bit A/D/A conversion and the processing power that only our digital modeling technology can reproduce.

A total of eight modules provide 54 effect types ranging from must-have historic sounds of DynaComp, Vox Wah, Crybaby Wah, to Harmonized Pitch Shifter, long delay and echo settings of up to 5 seconds, and many more. A multitude of high-performance choices opens up totally new creative possibilities.

Realistic drum sounds derived from PCM sources are arranged in a variety of rhythm patterns for different musical genres. The 40 rhythm variations include the steady 8-beat of rock and pop, funky 16-beat, a jazzy 4-beat, some great shuffle for blues sessions, and many more choices. Rhythm training is a cinch, and tap input allows you to specify the tempo easily.

Specifications such as a signal-to-noise ratio of 110dB and noise floor of -98dBm demonstrate a level of performance that's not usually seen in units of this class. Background noise is a thing of the past, resulting in superbly transparent sound. Zoom's original noise reduction (ZNR) removes noise in playing pauses, while maintaining a natural release even on the tail of sustained notes.

Its compact size and lightweight design make the G1N ideal for those who want plenty of effects and great performance without having to carry a lot of gear. Plus, its durable, reinforced body can withstand the rigors of use on stage or on the road.

You get 12 hours of continuous operation with four AA alkaline batteries when using the G1N anywhere from the studio to the stage. Or plug in the included AC adapter for extended use.

When you connect the optional footswitch (FS01, sold separately), you can switch patch banks or perform tap tempo input with your foot. You can also connect the optional expression pedal (FP02) to control effect parameters such as wah, pitch shift, volume, drive gain, modulation rate, mixing balance of delay and reverb in real time. With either option, you add a new dimension of control and versatility to this exceptional new pedal.

Ultimate Dynamics Effects Pedal

If tone is the name of your game, the COMPRESSOR/SUSTAINER CS400 will add amazing impact to your tone and provide endless sustain.

Dynamics play an important role in music. They help to convey emotion, whether it's a sultry blues solo or the unrelenting gallop of unfettered metal. But uncontrolled dynamics can take all your best intentions and turn them into so much, well..mush. That's where compression comes in, softening loud sounds and boosting low signal levels to keep everything more uniform. So, a compressor's main job is to make every note the same volume.

Ever notice how some strings on your guitar or bass sound louder than others? This is partly due to physics. Strings with lower mass just don't put out as much volume as the heavier ones. When used properly, a compressor makes all of the strings the same volume. Compressors are also great for slap-style bass players, making thumb slaps, string pulls and muted notes all the same volume, for an extremely percussive effect.

You can dial in the right amount of compression using the dedicated ATTACK and SUSTAIN dials. The LEVEL control allows you to set the output to subtle, or engage a monster volume boost. TONE lets you add exactly the right level of highs. From clean, snappy country leads to rock solos that scream for eons, the CS400 is built to make your sound the center of attention. Its LED tells you when it's on, and the top-quality on/off switch maintains outstanding signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power this scene-stealer with either a 9 V battery or our PSU-SB DC power supply (not included).

The COMPRESSOR/SUSTAINER CS400 is an affordable way to add some serious finesse to your playing. Check one out at your BEHRINGER dealer and let your playing take center stage.

650,"Polytune is a brand new pedal from TC Electronic that utilizes patented polychromatic tuning technology to show guitar and bass players an entirely new way to tune their instruments. With the addition of strobe and needle modes, players will enjoy extremely accurate tuning as well as a true bypass circuit. Let the Tuninig commence!

Tuning used to be a necessary evil. The last barrier before you could get truly rocking. But now, tuning is ready to get blasted into the 21st century with PolyTuneTM, the stomp-box sized tuning miracle from TC Electronic!

PolyTuneTM is the world's first polyphonic tuner, and a game-changing total tuning turnaround that will have future guitarists wondering how we ever got by without it.

It couldn't be done - until we did it
The magic lies in a never before seen approach to tuning aimed at speed, accuracy and ease of use. With PolyTuneTM, you simply strum all strings on your guitar or bass at once, and it will immediately tell you which strings need tuning! This cutting-edge tuning technology revolutionizes the way you tune and accomplishes what has been deemed 'impossible' until now: tuning all strings simultaneously! It really is as simple as strum - tune - rock, and this quantum leap forward allows you to get in tune fast, and back to doing what you love: playing.


Strum - Tune - Rock
Providing an instant overview of the pitch of all your strings, PolyTuneTM is an invaluable tool in live-settings, where it is essential to be in tune quickly and ready to play. Crowds don't want to wait around, they want to rock, and, let's face it, so do you. Besides live use, this stomp box will deliver like no other in any situation where you want to get tuning out of the way and focus on play.

Fever Pitch
Equally effective for guitar and bass, PolyTuneTM is extremely flexible as well. The reference pitch can be set to your preference and ranges from 435Hz to 445Hz. This guarantees you'll be able to play along with anyone, with any instrument and in any situation.

Drop it like it's hot
If you are a guitarist that likes to play at a different pitch than standard, this is your go-to pedal, allowing for dropped tunings from E-flat all the way down to B. Whatever your pitch or tuning, PolyTuneTM is a sure-fire way to be spot-on, with an accuracy of just plus/minus 1cent.

Chromatic champion
Besides the Polyphonic tuner, PolyTuneTM has a chromatic tuner that can hang with the best current tuning technology out there, with an amazing 0.5 cent accuracy. But we are never satisfied with the current norm, and added some features to make this tuner's chromatic section stand out from the crowd.

Tuning modes
Let's start with the two separate chromatic tuning modes, which cater to your individual preferences and needs. Needle mode is for those that are used to the classic view on a tuner. For the people that want a little more real-time information, we have included stream-mode, which measures even the slightest pitch variation and instantly feeds the info back to you via a rotating motion on the display.

Tuning Magnet
Key to both these great chromatic modes is an ultra-fast and precise response, which is achieved via the use of the unique tuner magnet feature. This slows down the needle once you get close to the desired pitch, making it much easier to get the job done quickly.

Ultra-Compact 150-Watt PA/Monitor Speaker System

What if you could mount your personal monitor on a mic stand and point it right at your face - and what if it sounded really good? What if it sounded so good it could be used as your main PA system for more intimate gigs and meetings? Say hello to the new B205D, an active PA loudspeaker that is small and light enough to mount on a mic stand. But don't let the small size fool you - the B205D cranks out high-fidelity sound and comes loaded with features that will simply astound you!

Thanks to our revolutionary Class-D amplifier technology and internal switchmode power supplies, not only do B205D loudspeakers sound great, they weigh considerably less than most competing active speakers. They pump out 150 of the cleanest, punchiest Watts you've ever heard from a compact loudspeaker, and you can link additional active loudspeaker systems via the handy THRU socket. A built in mixer provides three input channels, including a switchable instrument-ready input (no DI required), and also features a dedicated 3-band EQ (bass/mid/treble) for simple, yet effective tonal control.

Space limitations often make it impossible to place full-sized monitor wedges where they can do the most good - and passive monitors require lots of external amplifiers and processing gear to function properly. All this adds up to even more gear to move, and if you don't know what you're doing, you can easily damage passive monitors by applying too much, or even worse, too little power to them. With the B205D we've taken all the guesswork out, giving each loudspeaker its own 150-Watt, Class-D amplifier specifically designed as the perfect mate for the custom-engineered 5.25"" neodymium driver.

By using an internal switch-mode power supply, we reduced the weight of the B205D to a mere 7.0 lbs (3.2 kg). This means that instead of bringing in your old passive floor wedges one-at-a-time, you can carry all your monitors in one trip - without even breaking a sweat! They are small enough to mount on mic stands (each speaker includes a special mic stand integration system), on a tabletop, or they can be placed directly atop a piano or electronic keyboard.

Instead of operating relatively continuously like Class AB circuits, Class-D amps switch on and off thousands of times per second, delivering power only when needed. In other words, the amplifier is either fully on or fully off, which significantly reduces the power losses in the output devices.

When used in conjunction with switching mode power supplies, our Class-D amplifiers provide tremendous dynamic punch and superior fidelity. The resulting speakers systems are much lighter, making them easy to transport and set up. Our no-compromise design means your B205Ds deliver full power with incredible fidelity all night long, without the need for rest cycles.

Let's face it; the drivers (otherwise known as speakers) are the only part of a sound system you actually hear. So when it comes to ours, we don't cut any corners. While some of our competitors outsource theirs, we custom-design and build our speakers from scratch. We wind our own voice coils, process the paper pulp into cones and even machine our own speaker back plates and frames. This enables us to control the quality, keep production costs down and frankly, to make better components. The premium-grade 5.25"" neodymium driver was designed specifically and optimized solely for use in the B205D.

With just a single B205D loudspeaker system and a microphone, you can set up an instant, high-quality sound system. Thanks to the built-in preamp section, you just connect a dynamic mic and raise and lower the volume with the LEVEL control. Plug in your sound source (CD or MP3 player), place the speaker on a tabletop or mic stand and power up. It's just that easy. And if you need more coverage, you can chain together as many as you like via the convenient LINK OUTPUT XLR connector.

You can even use two B205Ds for stereo playback of your MP3, CD or cassette deck without any additional hardware - pretty cool for playing background music or making announcements. Just plug the appropriate stereo ""breakout"" adapter (not included) into your deck's output jack, run one cable to each loudspeaker and set the Level and EQ controls the same on both B205Ds. Voilà, instant party!

When it comes to live monitoring, it just doesn't get any more personal than this. With the B205D, you can literally put the sound where you want it - and the sound quality will simply astound you! It is small and light enough to mount on a mic stand (it comes with an integration kit that even works with boom stands), yet powerful enough to be used as a small, high-quality PA system. The built-in 3-channel mixer provides tremendous versatility and even allows additional systems to be linked as slaves.

The EUROLIVE B205D provides highquality sound, tremendous functionality and versatility for very little dough. Best of all, since the B205D is so compact and lightweight, making it easy for you to load in or out at the gig. Compare the B205D to the competition and you'll own BEHRINGER with money to spare!

665,"First introduced in 1958, the AC15 combo has been the amp of choice for countless guitar players throughout the world. Drawing on more than 50 years of amp-building expertise, the AC15C1 Custom Series offers maximum tonal dexterity. VOX Custom Series amps offer two channels: Normal and Top-Boost. Each channel is equipped with its own Volume control, and the Top Boost channel offers highly interactive Treble and Bass tone controls. This powerful channel pairing provides an abundance of tone-crafting control, letting you dial in a classic sound that is all your own. Both channels rely on the Tone Cut and Volume controls in the Master section. The Tone Cut control operates in the power stage rather than the preamp stage, allowing an additional degree of tone-shaping. The Master Volume control works in conjunction with the individual volumes of each channel to create just the right degree of gain-staging. By balancing the individual and Master volumes, the Custom Series can deliver everything from a clean VOX ""chimey"" sound to a powerful overdriven tone. You can sweeten the sound of your Custom Series amplifier using the VOX Classic Tremolo effect. Both the speed and the depth are adjustable, allowing you to generate just the sound you want. A warm Spring Reverb is also included on all Custom Series amps, adding spaciousness to the sound. All Custom Series amps can use the VOX VFS2 footswitch, allowing you to turn the Reverb and Tremolo effects on and off as you continue to play. The AC15C1 combo makes use of 3 x 12AX7 preamp tubes and uses pair of EL84 tubes to drive a single 12"" Celestion G12M Greenback. All models in the Custom Series offer a switchable 8/16 ohm output jack for powering an external speaker cabinet when you need to speak with a little more authority; using this jack will mute the internal speakers. Additionally, a 2nd extension speaker jack allows you to run an extra 16 ohm cabinet along with the internal speakers for a fuller sound.

Relay G30 redefines the wireless experience for guitarists and bassists. Its superior sound, professional dependability and refreshing simplicity are unavailable from other wireless systems.

Superior Sound
Relay G30 provides a pure signal. Its clarity rivals that of the highest-quality guitar cables. Guitars get a beautiful high-end sparkle and basses get a thunderous low-end punch, even at distances of up to 30 meters. Traditional wireless systems compromise their sound by rolling-off crucial high- and low-end frequencies and compressing their signals. Relay G30 offers superior sound with full bandwidth and zero compression.

Professional Dependability
Relay G30 broadcasts its robust signal over the 2.4GHz band. This keeps the signal free from many kinds of interference. For added security, Relay G30 employs exclusive signal protection technology: it broadcasts an encrypted data stream on six channels simultaneously.



Receiver features side-mounted 1/4-inch ins and outs and internal antennas, making it easy to add to a pedal board.

Switch between cable and wireless systems without having to adjust the tone settings on your amplifier.



Traditional wireless systems, on the other hand, are susceptible to dropouts, static and many other kinds of interference. Broadcasting over congested UHF bands, their signals may be affected by interference generated as far away as 160 kilometers, or more.

Refreshing Simplicity
Relay G30 is a low-profile system that's easy to use. The lightweight transmitter remains out of the way of your performance, and the rugged receiver can sit on top of your amp or be added to your pedal board. The receiver offers easy-to-read LEDs that display power, status and battery life.

Attached to Your Guitar Cable?
For players attached to cables, adopting a wireless system introduces many questions: What will it feel like? Will it change my sound? Relay G30 sounds just like a cable, but it also sounds just like your cable. Relay G30 features two EQ settings that match the frequency responses of typical guitar cables. Different players use different cables, but all players can use Relay G30.

VWT
Exclusive VWT (Virtual Wire Transmission) technology ensures full-range frequency response, excellent transient response, and wide dynamic range - just like a high-quality guitar cable.

Superior Specs
Relay digital wireless systems produce full-range tones with 10Hz-20kHz frequency response, exceedingly low noise with up to 120dB dynamic range, and studio-quality resolution with 24-bit A/D conversion. (Comparably priced analog wireless systems offer 50Hz-15kHz frequency response and >90dB dynamic range. This wreaks havoc on your tone, especially if you use a high-gain amp.)

Cable Tone Simulation
Using a cable and a wireless system? Now you can switch back and forth without having to adjust the tone settings on your amplifier. Relay digital wireless systems feature a Cable Tone Simulator, which lets you match the sound of your Relay to the sound of your cable.

Compander-Free
Companders squash your signal and ruin your tone. Analog wireless systems require companders but Relay wireless systems do not. Remaining compander-free enables Relay to deliver a beautiful high-end sparkle, thunderous low-end punch, and touch response that analog wireless systems simply cannot deliver.



Remaining compander-free gives better sound than analog wireless systems.

DCL
Exclusive DCL (Digital Channel Lock) technology automatically locks out all sources of interference. The only sound that will come out of your amplifier is you--not static, not Top 40 radio--just you.

2.4GHz broadcast
The best way to avoid interference? Don't get in its way. Relay digital wireless systems broadcast in the 2.4GHz band, which successfully avoids interference caused by TV stations, public safety broadcasts, cell phone towers, and other high-powered sources.

What About WiFi?
Worried about interference caused by 2.4GHz WiFi networks and Bluetooth devices? Don't be. Relay digital wireless systems use uniquely addressed and encoded digital transmission technology. Your tone will make it from your transmitter to your receiver free of interference.



Don't waste time scanning for open channels.

Full Quality, No Matter What
Whether you're playing two feet from your Relay G30 or at the edge of its range, you get the same great specs: full frequency response, superior dynamic range, cable-inspired dependability, and 24-bit A/D conversion.

All Channels, All the Time
All channels in all Relay digital wireless systems work all the time. Too good to be true? Maybe for an analog wireless system. Relay digital wireless systems are different. There's no website to reference, and no need to scan for open channels.

679,"Combine the high output and dynamic sound of steel with the smooth feel of nickel. Our signature Super Bullets are perfect strings for rock and other kinds of music requiring cutting guitar. Best of all, the patented bullet end creates a sonic coupling between the string and the bridge block, offering rock-solid tuning stability and increased sustain. Fender introduced its bullet-end electric guitar strings circa 1974 under the name “Super Bullets.” The new string-end design was especially well suited to Stratocaster guitars because the bullet ends fit far more precisely into the tremolo block, closely fitting the circumference of the string channel, and they slipped out easily when changing strings. They were available in pure nickel and nickel-plated steel versions for electric guitar and bronze-wound for acoustic guitars. Although Super Bullets electric strings could be used on many different guitars, they were especially popular with Stratocaster players. Super Bullets existed largely unchanged until the early 1990s, when Fender switched from zinc-plated steel to brass for the bullet ends. Brass had the additional advantage of imparting improved sustain. By the mid-1990s, Fender was offering pure-nickel bullet-end strings dubbed “Bullets,” nickel-plated steel bullet-end strings dubbed “Super Bullets, and bullet-end acoustic strings in bronze and phosphor bronze versions. Bullet-end stainless steel strings appeared in the late 1990s. Today, Fender continues to offer its classic bullet-end electric guitar strings in the strong, slender forms of its pure-nickel 3150 Original Bullets, which are ideal for vintage-style tone, and nickel-plated steel 3250 Super Bullets, which offer characteristic tonal power and durability.

These LEDS are numbered 1, 2, and 3, and they correspond to the three positions within each of the selection ranges, labeled A, B, C and D on each knob (see the Mustang I/II manual for a table listing the effects selection for each knob). Use the LEDs to determine exactly which position the knob is pointing to (using the factory settings of the “MOD” knob, for example, position 1 in the A selection range gives you chorus, position 2 in the A selection range gives you deep chorus, and position 3 in the A selection range gives you flanging).

Adjusting the effects levels on Mustang I and II couldn’t be easier—simply hold down the “EXIT” button while turning the “MOD” or “DLY/REV” knobs. Doing this adjusts “how much” of a particular effect you’ll get, according to your personal preference.

The amPlug series of palm-sized headphone guitar amps make it easy to enjoy great guitar/bass sounds at home, in your room, or anywhere. This lineup is now joined by the amPlug Joe Satriani signature model, which delivers instant rock star tone with delay, voiced to Joe Satriani's own specs.

With its bright red body, the ""amPlug Joe Satriani"" delivers the awesome sound of Joe Satriani's custom rig--distortion pedal through a high-gain vacuum tube amplifier, followed by a delay--and reproduces the settings created by Joe himself. Inspired by the distortion circuitry of the VOX/Joe Satriani Satchurator pedal, the amPlug Joe Satriani preserves much of the ""pick attack"" to create an articulate, playable distortion.

The amPlug plugs straight into your electric guitar, so you can instantly enjoy great sound through your headphones. Flick the switch to activate the analog-style delay effect. Inherited from the ""Lo-Fi mode"" of the VOX/Joe Satriani Time Machine delay pedal, the delay features Joe' distinctive EQ tone, combining both high-pass and low-pass filters.

An AUX input jack lets you jam along to tunes on your CD/MP3 player. Use the AUX input jack to plug your CD/MP3 player right into the amPlug and jam along. Play along with Joe Satriani's classic tunes, or with any of your favorite music. Enjoy the amPlug's extreme play-anywhere portability, with up to eleven hours of battery life.

Simply plug the amPlug directly into your electric guitar, connect your headphones, and you're ready to enjoy playing using Joe Satriani's powerful and expansive sound. Of course, you can also connect the optional amPlug Cabinet (sold separately) and create your own miniature amp stack.

The amPlug is convenient and portable with up to 11 hours of battery operation using alkaline batteries (3 hours using zince-carbon batteries).

Trust the BX5 D2 monitors from M-Audio® to deliver professional, accurate sound in your studio. The BX5 D2 monitors ensure you hear exactly what's happening in your mixes, so you can be confident that your music will sound its best in any listening environment. Premium components, advanced cabinet design, and efficient bi-amplification come together to provide superior audio reproduction.

The custom crossover is paired with two Class A/B amplifiers-one for each driver. This bi-amped design ensures that each driver is sent only the frequencies that it can reproduce most efficiently, producing clean power and plenty of headroom. The woven Kevlar low-frequency driver offers rich and articulate bass. The natural silk dome high-frequency driver uses a built-in waveguide to add clarity.

These impressive cabinets take up very little valuable space in your studio, yet are loaded with professional features, from radial-edge corners that reduce edge diffraction to magnetic shielding for safe use near video monitors. The bass porting is optimized to extend the low-end response, and there is an isolated chamber for the high-frequency driver. Pinhole LEDs aid in ""sweet-spot"" targeting.

M-Audio BX5 D2 studio monitors are equipped with both XLR and TRS balanced/unbalanced 1/4"" inputs, providing a solid connection to your studio mixer or other audio gear. The power switch, voltage selector, detachable power cord socket, and volume control are easily accessed via the rear panel. Acoustic isolation pads are included.

The BX5 D2 monitors use efficient bass porting, premium components, and two Class A/B amplifiers per cabinet to achieve cohesive sound across the entire frequency spectrum-plus exceptional imaging.

Looking for that Classic British sound of a VOX, Laney or Hiwatt for your next recording project? Easy! Grab yourself the JF-16 and you'll have all that classic rock ""over the pond"" sound nailed. Perfect for either a rhythm (top-boost) or lead channel simulator (if you have a nice, loud solid state guitar amp), the JF-16 circuit allows you to replicate the sound of these incredible amps, practically all of them! The British Sound delivers that 60s and 70s warmth and harmonic overdrive you hear on so many classic records.

The features on this overdrive pedal make it more than a tube-amp simulator. It's a tone-sculpting tool that Michelangelo himself could be proud of (if they had electrics guitars back then; he probably would have invented pedals). Using this Joyo for rhythm work, you can cover the Stones or Zeppelin no problem, and then just add a bit more gain to nail those guys' drive channel. The distortion benefits tremendously from the Mid control (many players love the Mid-Boost feature of the Vox amps, and you can't get that out of your stompbox with only a single Tone control). The British Sound has the full 3-band EQ, ""Voice"" control and the standard Output and Gain control knobs.. Alter one or two variables and you quickly create a new sound!

The JF-16 has the Brit Grit soul with the in your face (Fuzz - circa Clapton or Hendrix) raucousness of those true pioneers of rock. If you know funk and rock guitar of the 60s, early 70s and beyond, then you know and can appreciate this sound. Don't compLaney anymore, get the British Sound from Joyo Audio, then reach back into the past (or your old record collection) for inspiration. Cheerio!

Focusrite's Scarlett 2i2 is a 2 in/2 out USB recording interface featuring two award-winning Focusrite preamps. Housed in an attractive anodized aluminum unibody chassis, the interface not only sounds fantastic but looks great too. What's more, it's solid enough to take on the road when you travel.

The Scarlett 2i2 is much more than just a pretty metal box. For more than 25 years, Focusrite has designed some of the most popular microphone preamps in the industry. This experience has been used to create the transparent, low-noise and low-distortion preamp found not only in the Scarlett 2i2 but also the flagship FireWire interface, the Liquid Saffire 56. Plenty of available headroom makes it suitable for moving coil, condenser and ribbon microphones regardless of the source. Phantom power is provided for mics that need it.

The front panel Neutrik combination input can be used to connect line and instrument level signals as well as microphones. This makes it perfect for recording the output of a synthesizer or stage piano, while at the flick of a switch, you can cater to the output of an electric or acoustic guitar. Unique halo indicators let you know that you've got a good signal level for recording. Red means that your signal is clipping, and that you should reduce the gain. The halo will momentarily turn amber as the level returns to a healthy level, at which point it will turn green. A large monitor dial provides a tactile control for the volume of your speakers, while a high quality headphone amp provides a clean yet loud signal to headphones connected to the front panel socket. The direct monitor switch routes audio directly from the inputs to both the headphone and speaker outputs. This allows you to monitor the incoming signal with zero-latency.

Scarlett 2i2 features two high quality award-winning Focusrite mic pres. With more than 25 years of experience in designing analog equipment, Focusrite produces the best mic preamps in the industry. The preamps found in the Scarlett 2i2 are no exception to this, and share the same design as those found in our flagship interfaces: Saffire PRO 40 and Liquid Saffire 56.

Flick the direct monitor switch on the front panel of your 2i2 and you will hear what you're recording through your speakers or headphones, without the signal having to go through your computer. This avoids the possibility of latency, which can be distracting when recording. With 24-bit resolution at sample rates of up to 96 KHz, the digital conversion in the Scarlett 2i2 is of very high quality, meaning that every note and every subtle detail is captured with great clarity.

The anodized aluminum unibody chassis ensures that your Scarlett 2i2 can withstand the harsh environment of the road. It also makes Scarlett 2i2 the most beautiful interface around. Scarlett 2i2 is very light and compact making it easy to fit in a laptop bag. It's also bus powered, meaning that you don't need an additional power supply. Simply plug in to your computer and hit record.

Inside the box you'll find an authorization code for Ableton Live Lite (available via online download), as well as Focusrite's Scarlett Plug-in Suite and the Red 2 & Red 3 Plug­In Suite (AAX/AU/VST) upon registration of interface. Compatible with all major DAWs, Scarlett plug-in suite provides EQ, Compression, Gate and Reverb-essential tools for polishing your mix.

The Focusrite Scarlett series comes in a range of interface configurations. Use the chart to the left to compare models and find the right Scarlett for your recording needs.

829,"Nylgut has a specific density and acoustical qualities nearly identical to that of gut, and is the first truly successful synthetic version of the natural product. Other strong points of Nylgut are its elevated resistance to wear under tension-greater than that of gut-but even more important is its extraordinary immunity to changes of climate, considerably better than that of Nylon and thereby ensuring a superior stability of tuning under normal conditions

"
830,"A fundamental aim of Aquila's research has been to make a new synthetic product having the same acoustic properties as gut, but without its typical defects - (high cost, limited duration and high instability under varying climates). The New Nylgut has precisely these qualities allowing one to rediscover the sonorities familiar to the great 19th and 20th century Uke masters and guaranteeing a stability of tuning higher even than that of the best gut and nylon strings.

Designed for use on 6-string electric and acoustic guitars, the silver NS Tri-Action Capo assures buzz-free, in-tune performance at any fret. The patent-pending Tri-Action Geometry reduces the force required to open and close the capo and applies even tension regardless of neck profile. Combined with the micrometer tension adjustment that ensures the proper force is being applied to the neck of the guitar and direct horizontal pressure, the Tri-Action Capo virtually eliminates pulling the strings side to side and the need to retune during use.

The single hand, easy to operate Tri-Action Capo clamps to the headstock when not in use. An integrated pick holder stores your pick in a convenient location when playing fingerstyle. It is constructed from aircraft grade aluminum making it rugged enough to take a beating, but very lightweight on the fretboard. It adds negligible weight to the neck of the instrument and will not damage the finish.

855,"On December 10, 2007, Led Zeppelin took the stage at London’s O2 Arena to headline a tribute concert for dear friend and Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun. What followed was a two-hour-plus tour de force of the band’s signature blues-infused rock ’n’ roll that instantly became part of the legend of Led Zeppelin. Founding members Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones were joined by Jason Bonham, the son of their late drummer John Bonham, to perform 17 songs from their celebrated catalog including landmark tracks ""Whole Lotta Love,"" ""Rock And Roll,"" ""Kashmir,"" and ""Stairway To Heaven."" A film of the show, ""Celebration Day, is now available on DVD and Blu-ray and includes the entire concert in HD video and in 5.1, 48/24 hi-resolution audio surround sound. ""Celebration Day"" is an incredible document of the now legendary concert, which has been described as possibly the greatest rock and roll concert ever. The two hour feature length film is presented in beautiful high definition video, and stunning audio quality. The aspect ratio is 16x9. The film is directed by Dick Carruthers who had previously worked with Led Zeppelin on their award winning 2003 release ""DVD"" - a release that remains one of the highest selling music DVD's of all time. The ""Celebration Day"" film is already critically acclaimed and the DVD & Blu-ray releases are certain to become consistently high selling titles in the Led Zeppelin catalog. A bonus DVD in the deluxe versions features the dress rehearsal at Shepperton Studios, filmed a few days before the O2 concert. The rehearsal is filmed in SD and recorded in stereo.

Zoom's MS-50G MultiStomp Guitar Pedal is the first of its kind. It offers the power of a multi-effects pedal and flexibility of an amp modeler in a single stompbox design. With 55 classic stompbox effects and amp models, easy-to-use interface, auto-chromatic tuner and versatile power options, guitar players will be astonished with how much this pedal offers.

With a heavy duty, die-cast body, the MS-50G has the classic look of a single analog stompbox. It features a large LCD and analog-style cursor keys/parameter knobs that together form an easy-to-use graphical interface. This intuitive design makes creating, saving and rearranging the effect chain a breeze and provides easy navigation in live and studio settings.

A highly refined sigmoid curve clipper re-creates the smooth clipping of a tube amp's waveform. This allows the MS-50G to simulate amplifier sounds, including clean, crunch and full-gain drive tones that are authentic to the original models while maintaining the nuances of picking and strumming techniques.

The MS-50G's eight super-real amp models range from vintage gear to the latest trends in amp technology, each with its own distinct cabinet modeling that can be used to alter its tone characteristics. In addition, you can pair any of the available amp models with any of the available cabinet models and let you're creativity run wild. Power a VX JMI 2x12 cabinet with a Delux-R amp, or combine the MS 1859 amp and the DZ Drive 4x12 cabinet. It's up to you! The MS-50G also provides you with the versatility to match the output of a given amp/cabinet model to whatever you're playing through (Line, Combo Front, Stack Front, Combo Power Amp, Stock Power Amp).

The all-new ZFX-IV DSP effects processor boasts amazing power and clarity, upgrading everything from sound to functionality over previous ZFX versions. By using 32-bit floating-point processing, the MS-50G can produce sounds that are more realistic than ever before.

The MS-50G offers 47 diverse types of effects, including some of the world's most popular stompbox guitar pedals and rack-mounted processors. The pedal's wide range of effects includes distortion, compression, modulation, delay and reverb.

With the MS-50G, you can use up to six stompbox and amp effects simultaneously and arrange them in any order you like. This allows you the freedom to build complex tones, as well as the ability to bring individual elements in and out of the effects chain as you like.

Right out-of-the-box, the MS-50G allows you to create and store up to 50 of your original patches. To get you started, 30 of these patches are preprogrammed and form a versatile collection of guitar sounds that include some of the world's greatest stompbox and amp effects.

With the MS-50G, you can program which patches are recalled and the order in which they appear. For example, you could select three patches'(A) CLEAN TONE, (B) HEAVY RIFF and (C) LEAD SOLO'and program the MS-50G to cycle through only those three tones each time you press the footswitch.

Perfect for use in combination with traditional stompboxes, the MS-50G can be added to your pedalboard to decrease the size and complexity of your setup, while expanding your system's effects and modeling capabilities.

The pedal's highly accurate auto-chromatic tuner offers smooth, real-time response, which makes turning your guitar effortless. When you're in the middle of a performance or practicing alone, simply hold down the pedal's footswitch to start getting your strings back in tune. In addition, the MS-50G's LCD makes the tuner easy to see on a dark stage. You can also tune silently in the tuner's MUTE mode or with all effects bypassed in its BYPASS mode.

Providing versatile power options, the MS-50G operates via AC adapter (sold separately), as well as battery power. Two standard AA batteries (included) provide up to seven hours of continuous mono input use and up to five hours of continuous operation when using the stereo inputs.

875,"You will love our PROFESSIONAL SERIES 20 ft Guitar Cables. They have a nice flexible tweed jacket (not the stiff plastic jacket like others sell). Our cables have Oxygen-Free Copper for both the center conductor and the insulator shield. Plus our cables are double shielded with a Conductive PVC and OFC Insulator Shield. And most importantly, our cables have a VERY low Picofarad rating. Have you ever wondered why one guitar cable sounds better than another? They may look the same, but sound totally different? The main reason is the Picofarad rating. Most guitar cables have a high Picofarad rating. Some as high as 200 Picofarads per foot. A cable with a high Picofarad rating is much cheaper to make, and they will still work, but they will not sound as good. Our cables are rated at a SUPER LOW 38 Picofarads per foot (AWESOME). Most guitar cable manufactures don't even give you their rated Picofarads because they are so high. Why would you want to use a cheap cable with a hard plastic cover, no flexibility, and a high Picofarad rating? A good cable is just as important as a good guitar or amp. Our cables have an external rubber heat shrink strain relief, internal rubber booty strain relief, AND an internal metal clamp strain relief. This triple strain relief system allows for many years of trouble free usage.
