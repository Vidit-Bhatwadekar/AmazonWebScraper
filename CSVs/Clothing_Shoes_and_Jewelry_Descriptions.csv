This lightweight, compact luggage strap allows you to add a bag to your wheeled luggage or to a luggage cart. Now, while you navigate the airport, subway, or sidewalks, you won’t have to juggle a separate bag along with your phone or a cup of coffee in one hand while rolling your suitcase with the other hand. You also won’t have to strain your shoulders and back as the strap will do the heavy lifting for you.

The Add-A-Bag clips onto the top carry handle of virtually any upright suitcase and secures a second bag, such as a smaller piece of luggage, backpack, purse, laptop case, diaper bag, etc. After looping the strap through the handles and adjusting it to your desired length, you can move both as one unit.

The easily adjustable strap also makes sure that your bag hangs correctly from your luggage and does not drag on the ground or bounce around while you’re trying to maneuver. Additionally, it does not inhibit your ability to pull the suitcase.

The heavy-duty, quick-release buckle ensures that your bag stays securely attached. It’s also easy to detach when you need to access either bag. Its small size takes up very little space while it’s not in use so you can easily slip it into the side pocket of your carry-on when you’re done with it.

If you’re traveling with children, you can attach their stroller, car seat, baby carrier, or other belongings to your luggage so you can leave one hand free for helping and guiding them through the airport. You can also use this strap for smaller items such as travel pillows.

This Add-A-Bag luggage strap makes otherwise unwieldly bags easily transportable during your travels. The sturdy buckle secures your bag to a piece of luggage or a cart, and the strap adjusts to your ideal length. Whether you’re navigating the airport, subway, or crowded streets, this strap will free up your hands and relieve the strain of carrying a heavy load on your shoulders and back.



Free your hands and relieve the strain of carrying a heavy load. Provides a simple solution to attaching smaller luggage pieces to your cart or wheeled luggage.

In 1984, Meshbesher purchased a building in Chaseburg, Wisconsin without really knowing what they were going to do with it. That building became Chaseburg Manufacturing - Home of the SCRUSHER. In 1986, the company began producing the golf shoe SCRUSHER shoe brush after Meshbesher sold the idea to Standard Golf Equipment Company in Iowa. Now the SCRUSHER shoe and boot brush is on more than half of the golf courses in the U.S. and Europe. First came the golf shoe cleaner SCRUSHER, an industrial model and then a simple household shoe cleaner and boot cleaner version of Scrusher. In 1996 we built a new building in Coon Valley Wisconsin and expanded it again in 1998. Marcia passed away early in January of 2015 and we continue to build on her legacy of honesty, integrity and two SCRUSHERS for every household. One for the front door and one for the back door! Today the SCRUSHER shoe and boot cleaners come in many models, customized or personalized forms.

February Birthstone: Amethyst

Because of its regal purple hue, amethyst has long been a favorite of kings, queens, and other nobles. While it signifies wealth and strength, amethyst is also a symbol of soberness, tranquility, and wisdom.

History of Birthstones

Chances are you can name your birthstone, but have you ever wondered how certain stones came to be associated with particular months? Most gem scholars trace the tradition to the Old Testament story of Aaron, whose breastplate was decorated with twelve precious stones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Over time, these stones were linked with certain powers and tied to particular astrological signs, and later to calendar months.

There are many variations of birthstone lists, including Mystical birthstones, which originate from Tibet and date back over a thousand years, and Ayurvedic birthstones, associated with ancient Indian medicine and beliefs. Birthstones have also been tied to ancient Pagan religions, and even to the collective wisdom of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.

The modern birthstone list, perhaps the most universally known, was released by the American National Association of Jewelers and officially adopted in 1912. Whether you embrace birthstone lore, or look upon it with a skeptical eye, there is an undeniable appeal to collecting a beautiful gemstone that is reputed to hold special power, meaning, and good fortune just for you.

Gold Purity

The purity of gold is measured in karats. Pure gold measures 24 karats but is too soft in this state to be used effectively in jewelry. So it is alloyed with other metals--silver, copper, nickel, and zinc--to increase its strength and durability. Common measurements once the alloy is added are 18 karat (75% gold), 14 karat (58%), and 10 karat (47.7%). In the United States, the legal karat limit for the metal to still be considered gold is 10 karats. A higher karat measurement in gold content indicates a greater value of the jewelry piece. Gold jewelry should always be stamped with the karat mark, either 18k, 750 (European marking for 18k), 14k, 585 (European marking for 14k), or 10k. In addition, to assure its quality, the piece should be stamped with the manufacturer's trademark or country of origin.

Gold Color

The color of gold may vary based off of the type of metal alloy included and the percentage of the metal alloy used. Most commonly, gold is available in yellow, white, and rose coloring.

Yellow gold is the most common color and is usually alloyed with silver and copper. Yellow and white gold are similar in strength and malleability, making them perfect for jewelry that is worn daily.

White gold is alloyed with nickel, copper, and zinc--and while it looks similar to platinum, it has vastly different properties.

Rose-colored gold is alloyed with copper and is often used to accent white or yellow gold. The saturation of color varies from piece to piece and according to gold content.

Caring For Your Gold Jewelry

To keep gold shining and scratch-free, avoid contact with chlorine and other harsh chemicals. Do not wear jewelry during rough work and be sure to store it in a fabric-lined jewelry box or pouch. To clean gold jewelry, use warm water, a mild soap, and a soft bristled brush, if needed.

Gold jewelry should always be stamped with the karat mark, either 18k, 750 (European marking for 18k), 14k, 585 (European marking for 14k), or 10k. In addition, to assure its quality, the piece should be stamped with the manufacturer's trademark or country of origin.

Gold Color

The color of gold may vary based off of the type of metal alloy included and the percentage of the metal alloy used. Most commonly, gold is available in yellow, white, and rose coloring.

Yellow gold is the most common color and is usually alloyed with silver and copper. Yellow and white gold are similar in strength and malleability, making them perfect for jewelry that is worn daily.

White gold is alloyed with nickel, copper, and zinc--and while it looks similar to platinum, it has vastly different properties.

Rose-colored gold is alloyed with copper and is often used to accent white or yellow gold. The saturation of color varies from piece to piece and according to gold content.

Caring For Your Gold Jewelry

To keep gold shining and scratch-free, avoid contact with chlorine and other harsh chemicals. Do not wear jewelry during rough work and be sure to store it in a fabric-lined jewelry box or pouch. To clean gold jewelry, use warm water, a mild soap, and a soft bristled brush, if needed.

Gold Purity

The purity of gold is measured in karats. Pure gold measures 24 karats but is too soft in this state to be used effectively in jewelry. So it is alloyed with other metals--silver, copper, nickel, and zinc--to increase its strength and durability. Common measurements once the alloy is added are 18 karat (75% gold), 14 karat (58%), and 10 karat (47.7%). In the United States, the legal karat limit for the metal to still be considered gold is 10 karats. A higher karat measurement in gold content indicates a greater value of the jewelry piece.

About Skagen
Skagen Designs was founded in 1987 by Copenhagen natives Henrik and Charlotte Jorst, who operated from the belief that beautifully-designed, high-quality objects can be offered at reasonable prices. Taking their inspiration from the sheer and simple beauty of the Danish coastal landscape, the founders worked with well-known Danish designers to create a collection of elegant timepieces distinguished by their clean, pure lines and sophisticated styling. Skagen watches represent a harmonious blend of spirited design, beautiful craftsmanship, and expert precision.

The Skagen brand takes its name from the fishing village of Skagen, Denmark. In keeping with a European design aesthetic, Skagen watches for men and women are sleek, elegant, and modest timepieces boasting quiet precision. Skagen’s signature watch style includes a smooth mesh band and simple dial with subtle indices. While keeping true to its minimalist heritage, Skagen continually remains on the forefront, using modern watch materials and movements. Skagen watch collections today may feature carbon fiber textured dials and titanium or ceramic bands. With a modern or classic Skagen watch, you can be sure your look will withstand the test of time.

About Intimo
Started in 1990 by brothers Nathan Nathan and Tommy Nathan, Intimo was born on the belief that the flat landscape of men's underwear needed a super boost. Determined to shake things up, the brothers achieved immediate success with the introduction of luxury silk pajamas and loungewear which they sold to high-end retailers such as Neiman Marcus, Saks, and Federated.

Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes.  The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance.  Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker.

About Skagen Named after a fishing hamlet in Denmark on the northern tip of the Jutland peninsula, Skagen Designs was founded by Henrik and Charlotte Jorst in 1991 after the two Copenhagen natives moved to New York City. The company subscribes to the principle that beautifully designed, high-quality objects can be created at reasonable prices. Skagen watches represent the technical excellence, refined design and operational simplicity that have created the unique reputation of Danish design.

The fishing village of Skagen--the Skaw--lies where the northern-most tip of the Danish peninsula known as Jutland bends East and breaks the surging waters of the Kattegat and Skagerak seas. The spectacular natural beauty of the area is compellingly beautiful, and its white sandy beaches have been visited by artists for centuries.

Gemstones

Color

Jewelers describe the color of a gemstone in terms of three characteristics: hue, saturation, and tone. A gemstone's basic color is its hue, and those with purer hues (for emeralds, green; for sapphires, blue; and for rubies, red) are generally considered more valuable. Often, however, a hint of another color can be detected. Saturation is a measure of the intensity or purity of a gem's hue and is determined by the degree to which gray or brown hues mute its defining color. Value tends to increase with saturation, so a fully saturated purplish blue sapphire may well be more expensive than a muted pure blue one. The tone of a gemstone, a measurement of its lightness or darkness, is usually given as light, medium-light, medium, medium-dark, or dark.

Clarity

A flawless gemstone is rare and expensive. As with diamonds, most gemstones have inclusions, or tiny mineral flaws, that can be seen under magnification or by the careful eye. Make sure that any inclusions in the stone do not penetrate deeply into the gem, as this may cause it to break or crack. Clarity grades range from VVS (very, very slightly included) to I3, in which inclusions are prominent and severely affect the gemstone's beauty.

Cut

A gemstone's cut refers to its proportions and symmetry. In making a gemstone look appealing--the stone should be symmetrical in all dimensions so that it will appear balanced, and that its facets will reflect light evenly. Color should also be taken into account when cutting for optical efficiency. If a stone's color is highly saturated, a shallow cut will allow it to pass more light, while a deeper cut may increase the vividness of a less saturated gem. There is no generally accepted grading system for gemstone cut.

Size

Though a gemstone's weight is usually given in carats, this may not give an accurate idea of its size, because different types of stone have different densities. Therefore, a one-carat sapphire or ruby will be smaller than a one-carat emerald, though they have the same weight, because sapphires and rubies (both a form of the mineral corundum) are more dense than emeralds.

Gemstones can also be measured in dimensions (diameter, length, and width). It is important to know the dimensions to ensure that the gemstone weight will be visible and well-proportioned in the setting.

Gemstone Treatment

Gemstones are often treated to enhance color and fill cracks. Please note: if a gemstone has been treated, this information will be provided in the specifications on the stone's product detail page.

There are various accepted techniques, depending on the type of stone:

Oils and resins are frequently used to fill surface-reaching fissures in emeralds and rubies. This process is not permanent; however, if a treated ruby or emerald is subjected to high heat, the filler may leak out of the stone.

Sapphires and rubies are often heated in a kiln or furnace to enhance their color. Such heat treatment, which is considered permanent, has been used for centuries.

Lightly colored sapphires may also undergo diffusion treatment. This is done by heating a stone in the presence of coloring elements such as titanium or iron, which causes a thin layer of color to be diffused into the stone's surface. Because this color layer is so thin, a diffusion-treated sapphire should not be re-polished.

Gemstone Care

To clean gemstone jewelry, first wipe it with a soft cloth to remove any dirt. Emeralds require only the use of a soft cloth, as cleaners may damage these soft gems. Sapphires and rubies can be cleaned with either an ultrasonic cleaner or a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, with a soft brush. Store your gemstone jewelry in a soft cloth pouch or jewelry case so it does not touch other pieces in your collection. As with all jewelry, normal wear and tear can loosen prongs and settings, so it is a good idea to have it checked by a professional jeweler who can make repairs as needed.

About Columbia Sportswear
Founded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of ski-wear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.

Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that, it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60-year-old Gert began her role as ""Mother Boyle"" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.

The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.

Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

With the watch attached to your wrist, grip the bezel at the three o'clock and nine o'clock points and slowly twist counterclockwise.

The K. Alexander collection of pre-tied solid color bow ties is very popular to wear with tuxedos and is great for weddings, proms, schools, choirs, sports teams and individuals looking for a quality bow tie at a great price.

Style
The bow on these ties is approximately 4.5 inches wide by 2.25 inches tall. This makes it an updated traditional bow - it is slightly slimmed down and modern size - definitely not your Grandfather's fluffy bow tie. The material on the tie is a satin poly, with just the right amount of sheen, so that it's not too shiny nor is it flat. The bow on the tie is pre-tied, which means you don't have to learn to knot a bow tie and the bow is attached to an adjustable band which clips around your neck. This is a completely different mechanism than an old school clip-on or clip on style bow tie, which can easily fall off or become crooked.

Size
The adjustable band fits necks from 10.5 to 20.5 inches which should fit most adult men and most younger guys 12 and up. The slimmed down, modern size of this bow tie allows it to work for most guys except the larger big and tall group.

Colors
These bows ties are available in over 30 different colors we should have something to match your bridesmaid dresses or date to the prom. That said, the colors you see on your display device should only be used as a guide and are not absolute. There is no substitute to seeing the actual fabric in person.

644,"Outstanding performance and rugged good looks distinguish this masculine-looking watch from Bulova's Marine Star series. The attractive navy blue dial features three-hand function with luminous hands and markers for easy reading in the dark. It also offers a red-tipped sweep second hand and a day/date window at the three o'clock position. The dial is housed in a generous solid steel case and framed by a unidirectional rotating bezel for measuring elapsed time. The bezel has a blue enamel surface with a dive time scale and attractive and coin-edge detailing. The watch presents on a rugged link bracelet of brushed and polished steel fastens with a foldover buckle and safety clasp. Other notable features include precise quartz movement, a screw-down crown, and a scratch-resistant mineral crystal. Water-resistant to 200 meters, this watch is suitable for swimming and recreational scuba diving.



In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch.

Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams.

Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.

Decorative stitching and a sleek, elegant design make the Chicopee the ideal combination of fashion and optimum comfort.

In 1804, T. & A. Evans (Thomas and Amos) were running a small shoe business connected with a general store in the town of South Reading. There was no shoe factory as we know it today, just a small shop where Thomas and Amos cut the leather for their shoes. The actual shoe making was farmed out among the people of the town, while Thomas and Amos supplied them with uppers, soles, counters and heels to be assembled into shoes. All shoes were sewed by hand whenever the shoemaker-farmers could spare the time. Today L.B. Evans is owned and operated as a division of Daniel Green Enterprises. Many of the traditional gentleman's slipper styles are still part of the line, but the business has grown to include new updated classics, premium products including elk and deer, and an array or rugged, warm outdoor styles. Daniel Green Enterprises remains committed to the quality and comfort guarantee that the Evans brothers established over 200 years ago.

703,"Put more ""spring"" in your step with Spira's Classic walking shoe. Its dual spring technology reduces harsh impact so that you'll have complete comfort with every step. The durable leather upper and traditional lace-up is practical for every day, and full cushioning and traction will take you anywhere you want to go.

For years, athletic and comfort shoe engineers have been trying to create a buffer between the foot and the ground. Spira engineers have developed a solution--an energy return system that actually recycles expended energy back to the wearer.  It's called WaveSpring technology and it's found inside every pair of Spira shoes. With every step, energy is stored and then dispersed back to the wearer while providing the ultimate in cushioning. Testing performed by an independent source reported that the WaveSpring has up to a 96% energy return. Running, walking and standing for long periods of time can take a toll on the body, legs and feet. Spira's patented WaveSpring technology helps by taking a great deal of the burden off of the joints. Compared to Spira, regular athletic shoes require the wearer to exert greater effort. Muscles work harder, causing fatigue and increasing the risk of injury. By absorbing a greater amount of the impact of each step, Spira shoes manage to greatly reduce this risk and increase the wearer's enjoyment for the duration of the activity. While most shoes rely on compressive foams, air or gel materials to cushion the feet, the WaveSpring is mechanical and therefore will not lose its extraordinary ""new shoe"" feel over time. There is no significant cushioning breakdown throughout the life of the shoe. Spira’s WaveSpring technology intuitively reacts to the amount of energy and pressure a wearer exerts, and redistributes energy accordingly. Heel and forefoot spring configurations are engineered for specific activities. Experience the Spira difference and put a real spring in your step!

Maintaining Your Skagen Watch

All Skagen watches operate with standard batteries. When necessary, any jeweler can replace them for you. Different models are water resistant to varying degrees. Please refer to the back of your watch for the water resistant rating.

Cleaning Your Skagen Watch
Skagen suggests the following solutions for cleaning metal and crystal surfaces:

These suggested solutions will evaporate cleanly from metal and glass surfaces. Soap will leave residue behind when dry.

To clean the case and crystal:
Moisten a soft cloth with one of the above solutions. Gently wipe the case and crystal clean. Be careful not to put too much stress on the crystal as you clean. *NEVER immerse or soak the case/crystal portion of the watch, regardless of water resistance rating. Moisture could seep past the seals over time.

To clean the band or strap:
Skagen soft mesh bands are easily adjustable. Simply insert a small screwdriver or similar tool into the clasp. Lift up the clasp without applying pressure to the thin pin across the clasp and move to desired position. Snap closed securely. Make sure the clasp is set in one of the indentations on the back of the band. Link bands are completely adjustable anywhere watches are serviced.

Ray-Ban glasses feature high-quality G-15 non-polarized lenses, which provide superior 100% UV protection and enhance vision in multiple light conditions. Aviator sunglasses by Ray-Ban are comfortable unisex glasses that are offered in multiple frame- and lens-color options.

Made famous by the 1980s movie Top Gun and others, these Ray-Ban sunglasses for women and men are known for elegant wire frames that are durable and built to last. With a classic metal frame, you can see the world through a variety of lens colors including crystal-brown, crystal green, G-15 non-polarized, and more—all of which provide optimal visual clarity and 100% UV protection. G-15 lenses absorb 85% of visible light and block out most blue light. They provide amazing color contrast and produce better clarity and more natural vision. These sunglasses for women and men are comfortable to wear and make a statement anywhere you wear them. To keep them clean, we’ve included a lens cloth in the case.

Ray-Ban is the world’s most iconic eyewear brand and is a global leader in its sector. Every model in the Ray-Ban collection is the product of meticulous, original styling that translates the best of the latest fashion trends into an ever-contemporary look for millions of Ray-Ban wearers around the world. From the early Aviator style that emerged in 1937 to the introduction of the classic Wayfarer in 1952, Ray-Ban is a brand that embodies America, adventure, great cities, wide-open spaces, heroism, individuality, and authenticity.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

884,"An Automatic Watch is a mechanical watch that winds itself and does not require a battery. When worn daily, the movement of the wrist causes the mainspring to wind progressively, eliminating the need for additional winding. To start your automatic, you can hand wind it by rotating the crown clockwise a number of turns while in its normal operating position (screw down crowns will need to be unscrewed first), or by swinging it side to side for 30 seconds. We recommend housing an automatic in a watch winder box. Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more. Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors) or manually wind it.

To wind up the main spring: Manual winding - Fully wound up by turning the crown minimum 55 times. Fully wound up by turning the rachet wheel screw 8 times. Machine winding - Rotary speed 30 RPM and operation time 60 minutes

Invicta's Pro Diver automatic watch (model 9094) is perfect for the serious diver who also wants to turn heads with a stylish watch. This precise timepiece features a solid silver stainless steel case that measures 40mm (1.57 inches) wide, with a blue unidirectional rotating bezel with silver markings and coin-edged, scalloped highlights. It has a deep blue dial background with luminous Tritnite hands (with seconds hand) and dotted luminous dial markers with small minute indexes. The silver stainless steel bracelet band mixes brushed and polished links and is joined by a diver's buckle and safety clasp. Other features include date function at 3 o'clock and water resistance to 200 meters (660 feet).



Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

Pulsar by Seiko Holdings Corporation.

A spectacular breakthrough

Pulsar was born in an age of optimism. In the 1970's, everything seemed achievable through the rapidly growing technological expertise at the world's fingertips. Space flight had been converted from dream to reality, computer science was developing at break neck speed and electronics seemed to deliver new advances every day. Pulsar symbolized the age. It was new and it was bold, it was surprising and it was different. Pulsar, the world's first electronic digital watch, created a sensation when it was unveiled in New York in 1972 and it changed the world's perception of time.

A tradition of difference

When the brand was taken into the Seiko Corporation in 1980, it brought further surprises to the world^ the first calculator watch in 1980 and the first all-quartz watch line in 1981 were among its industry-leading achievements. And throughout the '80's and 90's Pulsar continued to bring to market new products that were born to be different. The Avant-garde collection in 1980's set a new style in women's watches and Spoon in 1990's were unique designs which further cemented Pulsar's image as an ingenious and surprising watchmaker.

Towards a modernist future

Today, Pulsar remains loyal to its heritage. It was born to be different and it will remain so. Each Pulsar watch has the hint of the futurism and modernity that have always been its hallmark. Pulsar is a brand for the individual who appreciates real value and seeks quality with individuality and flair.

Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes.  The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance.  Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide.

The canvas ballet slipper features pre-attached elastic at the heel for a custom fit, suede sole patches that glide delicately, a moisture-absorbent lining, and a sculpted, seamless arch that molds to the perfect fit.

Salvatore Capezio was born in 1871 in Muro Lucano, Italy. Uninterested in following in his father's footsteps as a construction engineer, he became an artist of his own right, a cobbler. In 1887, at the age of 17, he opened his shop on Broadway and 39th Street, diagonally across from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. Soon, the shop became a meeting place for dancers who would stop by to discuss their needs and to get a pair of his shoes. As Capezio's popularity grew, dancers from around the world made it a point to visit him and purchase his shoes.  The innovation of the products that Salvatore Capezio created and the camaraderie he shared with the dancers molded the direction that his company would follow. In this image, the Capezio brand was established to promote and recognize ongoing achievements and participation in dance.  Capezio products remain in the forefront in quality and in technological advances with innovations like the split-sole, the stretch-insert, the Dansneaker and the Tapsneaker. Capezio believes that their success is dependent upon the individual commitment of each customer to continually set new standards of creativity and performance, while preserving a reputation for dependability and distinction. Capezio pledges their support and dedication to the advancement of dance, theater and recreation in communities worldwide.

December Birthstone: Blue Topaz

Blue topaz is prized for its soothing and captivating blue color, which is usually divided into three categories: sky blue for the palest shade, Swiss blue for the more saturated medium shade, and London blue for the deepest shade. Also known as an artist's stone, blue topaz is reputed to inspire creativity and enhance concentration.

History of Birthstones

Chances are you can name your birthstone, but have you ever wondered how certain stones came to be associated with particular months? Most gem scholars trace the tradition to the Old Testament story of Aaron, whose breastplate was decorated with twelve precious stones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Over time, these stones were linked with certain powers and tied to particular astrological signs, and later to calendar months.

There are many variations of birthstone lists, including Mystical birthstones, which originate from Tibet and date back over a thousand years, and Ayurvedic birthstones, associated with ancient Indian medicine and beliefs. Birthstones have also been tied to ancient Pagan religions, and even to the collective wisdom of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.

The modern birthstone list, perhaps the most universally known, was released by the American National Association of Jewelers and officially adopted in 1912. Whether you embrace birthstone lore, or look upon it with a skeptical eye, there is an undeniable appeal to collecting a beautiful gemstone that is reputed to hold special power, meaning, and good fortune just for you.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

Kinetic: A powerhouse in technological innovation

Like mechanical and quartz, Kinetic is a platform. Over the past 20 years, SEIKO has created on this platform a suite of Kinetic movements, each bringing unique features to the consumer.

It was at the 1986 Basel Fair that SEIKO unveiled its first Kinetic prototype. Introduced under the trial name of 'AGM', it was the first watch in the world to convert kinetic movement into electrical energy. It was the first step in a development that, 20 years later, has made Kinetic synonymous with environmental friendliness, high performance and long-lasting convenience to a generation of users worldwide. From the launch in 1988 of the first commercially available watch (then under the new name AGS) until today, over eight million Kinetic watches have been sold (as of 2007).

In 1998, Kinetic Auto Relay was released, extending the 'at-rest' operating period of the watch to a remarkable 4 years. 1999 saw the launch of the Ultimate Kinetic Chronograph, a masterpiece which fused the very best of SEIKO's mechanical and electronic watch making skills, and in 2003 another Kinetic Chronograph was launched. At Baselworld 2005, the Kinetic Perpetual made its first appearance, combining Kinetic convenience and longevity with a perpetual calendar, correct to the year 2100. In 2007, SEIKO's emotional technology Kinetic Direct Drive is introduced.

Goodyear welt is a shoe construction in which the upper and sole of the shoe are stitched together for greater durability rather than glued. The resulting seam is visible and runs around the outside of the shoe, where the upper and outsole meet.

About Dr. Martens



By 1959 the two decided that they needed a company to produce and distribute the shoes, then called Dr. Maertens, in other parts of the world. At first, many manufacturers rejected the concept of an air cushioned sole as a short-lived gimmick. However, the R. Griggs Group, located in the village of Wollaston in England, decided to go along with the idea by creating the first work boot with the revolutionary sole. On the first of April 1960, the first cherry red eight-eyelet work boot was produced and named 1460 (1/4/60). To sell the brand name better in England, the name was anglicized to Dr. Martens. The range was branded AirWair and the rest is history.

This durable boot has a unique air-cushioning system that aims to please, while the thick outsole ensures a strong step. And of course, that iconic welt stitching and pull tab is always a bonus.

It all began near Munich, Germany in 1945 when Dr. Klaus Maertens injured his foot in a skiing accident in the Bavarian Alps. To make walking easier during the healing process, he designed a shoe with an air-cushioned sole. Using old rubber tires, he constructed soles that had air trapped within closed compartments. He showed his prototype to his engineer/inventor friend, Dr. Herbert Funck, and together they decided to develop and produce the shoes. Not only did the shoe solve the doctor's immediate problem, but it also started to sell well in Germany.

Jeff had always been interested in footwear and with a little help from a few friends Sanuk was born.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper.

With rugged good looks to match its superior performance, this professional dive watch from Seiko is an excellent choice for all of your adventures--in or out of the water. The generously-sized 45 mm steel case showcases a bright orange dial with bold luminous hands and markers, a luminous seconds hand, and a large day/date window at the three o'clock hour. A highly scratch-resistant curved Hardlex crystal magnifies the dial, optimizing its readability. The dial is framed by a unidirectional rotating steel bezel with engraved dive time markers for safe timing of dives and other limited events. The 21-jewel Japan automatic movement means this watch winds itself with the natural motion of your wrist and never requires a battery. The watch presents on a durable contoured rubber strap with a buckle closure. Designed for scuba diving, it features a screw-down crown and caseback and is rated water resistant to 200 meters.

About Seiko
In 1877, at the age of 18, Kintaro Hattori set up business repairing the Western-style clocks that were becoming increasingly popular in Japan. By 1892, Hattori was manufacturing his own clocks in a factory he called Seikosha, from the words ""seiko"" meaning ""exquisite,"" ""success,"" or ""miniature,"" and ""sha"" meaning ""house."" The company grew and prospered, producing its first wristwatch in 1913 and launching the Seiko brand in 1924. Technological innovation has always been a driving force in the company's history. Key milestones include Seiko's introduction of the world's first quartz watch in 1969, and its successful launch, in 1988, of the Kinetic, the world's first battery-free watch with quartz accuracy. Recognized for its technological excellence, Seiko has provided timekeeping services for the Olympic Games and the World Cup Soccer Championships. Today, the Seiko brand continues to stand for state-of-the-art technology, as well as superior quality and refined design.

1270,"Bold styling combines with a classic design in this automatic watch #8928 from Invicta's Pro Diver collection. This sporty yet refined timepiece features a two-tone gold-plated and silver-tone stainless steel case, bezel, and bracelet strap. Protected by an anti-reflective mineral crystal with magnifier, a vivid blue dial showcases easy-to-read hands and markers, as well as a date display at three o'clock. Automatic 21-jewel movement is both shock resistant and reliable, while water resistance to 200 meters (660 feet) helps guard against the elements.

Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

Paul raced back to his laboratory to begin working. Using pieces of rubber, a razor blade, and an ordinary sneaker, Paul had soon pieced together the prototype of the world's first boat shoe. Subsequent designs yielded the original Sperry Top-Sider now known as the Authentic Original. Since 1935, Sperry Top-Sider has been the leading brand of footwear for those who love the water.

This is an automatic mechanical watch. Automatic watches do not operate on batteries; instead, they are powered automatically by the movement of the wearer’s arm. If the main spring in your automatic watch is not wound sufficiently, timekeeping may become less accurate. In order to maintain accuracy, wear the watch for 8 hours or more per day, or manually wind the main spring by turning the crown. When not in use, automatic watches may be kept charged with an automatic watch winder – a watch storage unit which may be purchased separately.

About Skagen Named after a fishing hamlet in Denmark on the northern tip of the Jutland peninsula, Skagen Designs was founded by Henrik and Charlotte Jorst in 1991 after the two Copenhagen natives moved to New York City. The company subscribes to the principle that beautifully designed, high-quality objects can be created at reasonable prices. Skagen watches represent the technical excellence, refined design and operational simplicity that have created the unique reputation of Danish design.

The fishing village of Skagen--the Skaw--lies where the northern-most tip of the Danish peninsula known as Jutland bends East and breaks the surging waters of the Kattegat and Skagerak seas. The spectacular natural beauty of the area is compellingly beautiful, and its white sandy beaches have been visited by artists for centuries.

The Skagen brand takes its name from the fishing village of Skagen, Denmark. In keeping with a European design aesthetic, Skagen watches for men and women are sleek, elegant, and modest timepieces boasting quiet precision. Skagen’s signature watch style includes a smooth mesh band and simple dial with subtle indices. While keeping true to its minimalist heritage, Skagen continually remains on the forefront, using modern watch materials and movements. Skagen watch collections today may feature carbon fiber textured dials and titanium or ceramic bands. With a modern or classic Skagen watch, you can be sure your look will withstand the test of time.

Prized for its durability and unique illumination system, the Luminox Original Navy SEAL Series 1 stainless steel men's watch exudes confidence and power whenever it's worn. Thanks to the vaunted Luminox self-powered illumination system, this watch's hands and dial markers glow 100 times brighter than other luminous watches and will provide continuous illumination for more than 25 years. It's also water resistant to 200 meters (20 ATM, 660 feet), which is suitable for recreational scuba diving.

The large, black-plated stainless steel watch case--measuring 1.7 inches wide and 0.4 inches thick--is topped by a ratcheting, unidirectional rotating bezel with engraved 5-minute Arabic numerals in white and coin-edged detailing for an improved grip. The black dial face is accented by white Arabic numeral markers, large white baton hands (with seconds hand), and a date function at 3 o'clock. It's completed by a comfortable polyurethane (PU) diver's strap in black. Other features include a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal with anti-reflective coating, multi-jeweled Swiss quartz watch movement, double gasket crown, and 4-year battery life. It's backed by a 1-year Luminox warranty.

Luminox Self-Powered Illumination System
Each Luminox watch employs tiny self-powered micro gas lights (borosilicate glass capsules), which are firmly embedded in the hands and the hour indicators on the watch face (as well as on the turning ring of diver's watches). Luminox watches need no external light source to ""charge"" the paint on the dial or hands in order to glow as do conventional luminous watches, nor do they require a push of a button to light the dial as do electro luminescent watches.

About Luminox
Luminox combines the finest tradition and precision of Swiss watchmaking with the durability demanded by US armed forces and the latest innovations in timepiece technology. The company pioneered the development of small, individual luminescent tracer lamps and was contacted by the U.S. Navy SEAL teams to build a dive watch for their use on night missions. After their popularity in the Navy grew, the Air Force asked Luminox to develop a watch specifically for F-117 Nighthawk Stealth pilots.

Remember: nothing shines like Duragold.

Gold Purity

The purity of gold is measured in karats. Pure gold measures 24 karats but is too soft in this state to be used effectively in jewelry. So it is alloyed with other metals--silver, copper, nickel, and zinc--to increase its strength and durability. Common measurements once the alloy is added are 18 karat (75% gold), 14 karat (58%), and 10 karat (47.7%). In the United States, the legal karat limit for the metal to still be considered gold is 10 karats. A higher karat measurement in gold content indicates a greater value of the jewelry piece. Gold jewelry should always be stamped with the karat mark, either 18k, 750 (European marking for 18k), 14k, 585 (European marking for 14k), or 10k. In addition, to assure its quality, the piece should be stamped with the manufacturer's trademark or country of origin.

Gold Color

The color of gold may vary based off of the type of metal alloy included and the percentage of the metal alloy used. Most commonly, gold is available in yellow, white, and rose coloring.

Yellow gold is the most common color and is usually alloyed with silver and copper. Yellow and white gold are similar in strength and malleability, making them perfect for jewelry that is worn daily.

White gold is alloyed with nickel, copper, and zinc--and while it looks similar to platinum, it has vastly different properties.

Rose-colored gold is alloyed with copper and is often used to accent white or yellow gold. The saturation of color varies from piece to piece and according to gold content.

Caring For Your Gold Jewelry

To keep gold shining and scratch-free, avoid contact with chlorine and other harsh chemicals. Do not wear jewelry during rough work and be sure to store it in a fabric-lined jewelry box or pouch. To clean gold jewelry, use warm water, a mild soap, and a soft bristled brush, if needed.

Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

Tritnite is a luminous material with an extended glow exclusively developed by Invicta in Switzerland and added to their timepiece hands and markers. When exposed to regular daylight, it will hold its glow for about 20 hours.

About Invicta
Latin for ""invincible,"" Invicta was founded in La Chaux-de-fonds, Switzerland in 1837 by Raphael Picard, who believed that fine Swiss timepieces could be offered at modest prices. For more than a century, the company has created distinctive manual and automatic-winding pieces. In 1991, descendants of the Picard family reaffirmed the company's founding principle, and the invigorated Invicta has been growing ever since with one of the most widely diverse collections of precise Swiss timepieces on the market.

An instruction manual and an application for the extended warranty program are also included. About Automatic Movements Exhibition case backs make for great complications. This is especially true when they display automatic movements. Automatic movements stem from mechanical movements with one key difference: a mechanism automatically winds the timepiece's mainspring as opposed to forcing the wearer to manually wind. This occurs thanks to a weighted rotor that spins on its own axis, continually charging the mainspring. Timepieces with automatic movements are meant to be appreciated for the craftsmanship and complex aesthetic that they provide and are a must-have for any watch enthusiast!

It's topped by a blue unidirectional rotating elapsed time bezel with white markings.

Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

1596,"The Original Swiss Army Knife was created by Victorinox in 1897 in the small Swiss village of Ibach. Since then, Victorinox has earned a reputation the world over for quality, functionality, versatility, and precision. Victorinox Swiss Army watches embody this century-old tradition by combining the well-known Victorinox durability with ingenious design. Be equipped for the adventures of life with a classically-styled Swiss Army watch.



Master Cutler Karl Elsener opened a cutlery shop in Ibach, Switzerland in 1884. Seven years later, in 1891, Karl supplied the Swiss Army with its standard issue Soldier’s Knife. After the death of his mother in 1909, Karl Elsener introduced the brand name Victoria and the iconic Cross and Shield emblem is registered as a trademark. With the advent of stainless steel, Karl Elsener coined the company’s name, Victorinox, by combining his mother’s name with “inox”, an abbreviation of the French word for rust-resistant steel, “inoxydable”. After World War II, the “Original Swiss Army Knife” began its successful progression around the world and enjoyed exceptional popularity. In 1989, Victorinox entered the timepiece business in the United States under the brand name “Swiss Army”. Ten years later, Victorinox joined the Travel Gear market, partnering with TRG Group in St. Louis. And in 2001, Victorinox fashion was introduced in the US to further capture the brand’s essence of practical luxury. In 2002, in order to promote global unity, the Victorinox Swiss Army timepiece brand was launched internationally. In 2007, Victorinox set up Victorinox Swiss Army Fragrance AG, and in 2009 Victorinox Swiss Unlimited was launched. 2014 marks Victorinox Swiss Army’s 130th anniversary, and each Victorinox Swiss Army product embodies the spirit of the Legendary Original Swiss Army Knife, a universal symbol of Functionality, Innovation, Quality and Iconic Design.

Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

Keen products put an emphasis on the joys of play. At the same time, Keen believes in the value of working hard to give back to the community. To that end, the company has partnered with non-profit organizations around the world to help get youth into the outdoors, protect land for its environmental and recreational value, and to give bikes to kids in need.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

About Skagen Named after a fishing hamlet in Denmark on the northern tip of the Jutland peninsula, Skagen Designs was founded by Henrik and Charlotte Jorst in 1991 after the two Copenhagen natives moved to New York City. The company subscribes to the principle that beautifully designed, high-quality objects can be created at reasonable prices.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

Diamond Clarity:

No two diamonds are alike. A diamond's most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler's magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond's clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond's clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.



Diamond Color:

Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.



Diamond Carat Weight:

A diamond's weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.



Diamond Certification:

A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.

Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.

Our Diamond Policy:

Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world's largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.

Diamond Care:

Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.

Classic styling and high performance add up to an outstanding sport watch for your land or sea adventures. This two-tone automatic watch, from Invicta's Pro Diver series, places a large round stainless steel case on a robust steel bracelet with gold-plated center links. The electric blue dial is designed for quick and easy read-off, even in low light conditions. It offers three-hand function with luminous hands and markers and a magnified date display at the three o'clock position. The detailed hands, in Mercedes, sword, and breguet-style logo shapes, add a note of distinction. The dial is capped with a resilient mineral crystal and framed by a blue unidirectional rotating steel bezel with goldtone markings and coin edge detailing. This watch is driven by a Japanese automatic movement, which is visible through the see-through skeleton case back. It is rated water resistant to a full 200 meters.



Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.



Automatic Watches

Automatic watches do not operate on batteries. Automatic watches are made up of about 130 or more parts that work together to tell time. Automatic movements mark the passage of time by a series of gear mechanisms, and are wound by the movement of your wrist as you wear it. The gear train then transmits the power to the escapement, which distributes the impulses, turning the balance wheel. The balance wheel is the time regulating organ of a mechanical watch, which vibrates on a spiral hairspring. Lengthening or shortening the balance spring makes the balance wheel go faster or slower to advance or retard the watch. The travel of the balance wheel from one extreme to the other and back again is called oscillation. Lastly, automatic movements come in different types, including movements that are Swiss-made, Japanese-made, and more.

Also referred to as self-winding, watches with automatic movements utilize kinetic energy, the swinging of your arm, to provide energy to an oscillating rotor to keep the watch ticking. They're considered more satisfying to watch collectors (horologists) because of the engineering artistry that goes into the hundreds of parts that make up the movement. If you do not wear an automatic watch consistently (for about 8 to 12 hours a day), you can keep the watch powered with a watch winder (a great gift for collectors).

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

The most popular product was a buckle of a mountain on the back that became the company's calling card. When The Mountain incorporated and introduced its first t-shirt back in the early 90s, The Mountain company has defined itself an eco-friendly apparel manufacturer. On that epic moment in history we made a very important decision to put the environment first by choosing water based inks and organic reactive dyes as the foundation of our production process.

Gemstones

Color

Jewelers describe the color of a gemstone in terms of three characteristics: hue, saturation, and tone. A gemstone's basic color is its hue, and those with purer hues (for emeralds, green; for sapphires, blue; and for rubies, red) are generally considered more valuable. Often, however, a hint of another color can be detected. Saturation is a measure of the intensity or purity of a gem's hue and is determined by the degree to which gray or brown hues mute its defining color. Value tends to increase with saturation, so a fully saturated purplish blue sapphire may well be more expensive than a muted pure blue one. The tone of a gemstone, a measurement of its lightness or darkness, is usually given as light, medium-light, medium, medium-dark, or dark.

Clarity

A flawless gemstone is rare and expensive. As with diamonds, most gemstones have inclusions, or tiny mineral flaws, that can be seen under magnification or by the careful eye. Make sure that any inclusions in the stone do not penetrate deeply into the gem, as this may cause it to break or crack. Clarity grades range from VVS (very, very slightly included) to I3, in which inclusions are prominent and severely affect the gemstone's beauty.

Cut

A gemstone's cut refers to its proportions and symmetry. In making a gemstone look appealing--the stone should be symmetrical in all dimensions so that it will appear balanced, and that its facets will reflect light evenly. Color should also be taken into account when cutting for optical efficiency. If a stone's color is highly saturated, a shallow cut will allow it to pass more light, while a deeper cut may increase the vividness of a less saturated gem. There is no generally accepted grading system for gemstone cut.

Size

Though a gemstone's weight is usually given in carats, this may not give an accurate idea of its size, because different types of stone have different densities. Therefore, a one-carat sapphire or ruby will be smaller than a one-carat emerald, though they have the same weight, because sapphires and rubies (both a form of the mineral corundum) are more dense than emeralds.

Gemstones can also be measured in dimensions (diameter, length, and width). It is important to know the dimensions to ensure that the gemstone weight will be visible and well-proportioned in the setting.

Gemstone Treatment

Gemstones are often treated to enhance color and fill cracks. Please note: if a gemstone has been treated, this information will be provided in the specifications on the stone's product detail page.

There are various accepted techniques, depending on the type of stone:

Oils and resins are frequently used to fill surface-reaching fissures in emeralds and rubies. This process is not permanent; however, if a treated ruby or emerald is subjected to high heat, the filler may leak out of the stone.

Sapphires and rubies are often heated in a kiln or furnace to enhance their color. Such heat treatment, which is considered permanent, has been used for centuries.

Lightly colored sapphires may also undergo diffusion treatment. This is done by heating a stone in the presence of coloring elements such as titanium or iron, which causes a thin layer of color to be diffused into the stone's surface. Because this color layer is so thin, a diffusion-treated sapphire should not be re-polished.

Gemstone Care

To clean gemstone jewelry, first wipe it with a soft cloth to remove any dirt. Emeralds require only the use of a soft cloth, as cleaners may damage these soft gems. Sapphires and rubies can be cleaned with either an ultrasonic cleaner or a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, with a soft brush. Store your gemstone jewelry in a soft cloth pouch or jewelry case so it does not touch other pieces in your collection. As with all jewelry, normal wear and tear can loosen prongs and settings, so it is a good idea to have it checked by a professional jeweler who can make repairs as needed.

December Birthstone: Blue Topaz

Blue topaz is prized for its soothing and captivating blue color, which is usually divided into three categories: sky blue for the palest shade, Swiss blue for the more saturated medium shade, and London blue for the deepest shade. Also known as an artist's stone, blue topaz is reputed to inspire creativity and enhance concentration.

History of Birthstones

Chances are you can name your birthstone, but have you ever wondered how certain stones came to be associated with particular months? Most gem scholars trace the tradition to the Old Testament story of Aaron, whose breastplate was decorated with twelve precious stones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Over time, these stones were linked with certain powers and tied to particular astrological signs, and later to calendar months.

There are many variations of birthstone lists, including Mystical birthstones, which originate from Tibet and date back over a thousand years, and Ayurvedic birthstones, associated with ancient Indian medicine and beliefs. Birthstones have also been tied to ancient Pagan religions, and even to the collective wisdom of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.

The modern birthstone list, perhaps the most universally known, was released by the American National Association of Jewelers and officially adopted in 1912. Whether you embrace birthstone lore, or look upon it with a skeptical eye, there is an undeniable appeal to collecting a beautiful gemstone that is reputed to hold special power, meaning, and good fortune just for you.

2237,"Bring out the performer in your little one with the Fisher Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage. Your child will enjoy grooving to fun songs with the ""magical"" microphone and pretend musical instruments. Designed for children ages six months and older, this toy provides several developmental benefits, such as encouraging motor skill development and problem-solving skills, and provides visual and auditory stimulation.



Different Stages to Grow with Baby
The Sing-Along Stage includes two levels of advancement for babies and toddlers. Each mode offers just enough difficulty for your little one to be challenged and have fun at the same time. For babies from 6 months of age, the stage is just the right height to sit and play. He or she can discover how to shake the microphone to make a song play! Your baby can also learn how to press each musical instrument to hear it play a solo, learning to differentiate between the different sounds. Musical lyrics are provided for you to sing along with the songs, providing quality interactive time with your baby. As your child gets older, he or she can stand, dance, and groove with the magical microphone while the music plays. In this more advanced secondary mode, the toy allows your child to get creative with the music. Start the song by pressing the button. Shake the microphone to add voice. Press each instrument to add their sounds to the song. This toy requires three AA batteries, which are included in the package. Adult assembly is necessary and requires a Phillips screwdriver (not included).

What's in the Box
1 Fisher Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage, play microphone, and 3 AA batteries.

Little ones love to be in the spotlight-and they love to sing, dance and move! The road to stardom starts right here, with a jam-packed stage that encourages singing, dancing, discovery, and all-around self-expression. Baby can start the fun with a shake of the microphone, hear plenty of music and singing (with a medley of different voices!) and see a reflection of greatness in the large, clear mirror. With two modes of play, there's lots of sing-along and song building fun! In mode 1, there is continuous play where baby activates any of the four instruments and gets a full song while music and lights dance along as baby plays. In mode 2 interactive play encourages baby to ""play"" the instruments and shake the magical microphone to get a light show and musical reward. Requires 3 AA batteries.

Dr. Martens is the stuff of legends. It all began near Munich, Germany in 1945 when Dr. Klaus Maertens injured his foot in a skiing accident in the Bavarian Alps. To make walking easier during the healing process, he designed a shoe with an air-cushioned sole. Using old rubber tires, he constructed soles that had air trapped within closed compartments. He showed his prototype to his engineer/inventor friend, Dr. Herbert Funck, and together they decided to develop and produce the shoes. Not only did the shoe solve the doctor's immediate problem, but it also started to sell well in Germany. By 1959 the two decided that they needed a company to produce and distribute the shoes, then called Dr. Maertens, in other parts of the world. At first, many manufacturers rejected the concept of an air cushioned sole as a short-lived gimmick. However, the R. Griggs Group, located in the village of Wollaston in England, decided to go along with the idea by creating the first work boot with the revolutionary sole. On the first of April 1960, the first cherry red eight-eyelet work boot was produced and named 1460. To sell the brand name better in England, the name was anglicized to Dr. Martens. The range was branded AirWair and the rest is history.

Diamond Clarity:

No two diamonds are alike. A diamond's most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler's magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond's clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond's clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.



Diamond Color:

Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.



Diamond Carat Weight:

A diamond's weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.



Diamond Certification:

A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.

Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.

Our Diamond Policy:

Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world's largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.

Diamond Care:

Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.

December Birthstone: Blue Topaz

Blue topaz is prized for its soothing and captivating blue color, which is usually divided into three categories: sky blue for the palest shade, Swiss blue for the more saturated medium shade, and London blue for the deepest shade. Also known as an artist's stone, blue topaz is reputed to inspire creativity and enhance concentration.

History of Birthstones

Chances are you can name your birthstone, but have you ever wondered how certain stones came to be associated with particular months? Most gem scholars trace the tradition to the Old Testament story of Aaron, whose breastplate was decorated with twelve precious stones, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Over time, these stones were linked with certain powers and tied to particular astrological signs, and later to calendar months.

There are many variations of birthstone lists, including Mystical birthstones, which originate from Tibet and date back over a thousand years, and Ayurvedic birthstones, associated with ancient Indian medicine and beliefs. Birthstones have also been tied to ancient Pagan religions, and even to the collective wisdom of the legendary lost city of Atlantis.

The modern birthstone list, perhaps the most universally known, was released by the American National Association of Jewelers and officially adopted in 1912. Whether you embrace birthstone lore, or look upon it with a skeptical eye, there is an undeniable appeal to collecting a beautiful gemstone that is reputed to hold special power, meaning, and good fortune just for you.

This Seiko Diver men's diver's watch combines technology, with a rugged and stylish design. The 22-millimeter-wide bracelet with a fold-over safety clasp transitions smoothly into the classic round 45-millimeter case, both of which are constructed of stainless steel with a bright, polished silver finish. Encased safely inside a scratch-resistant Hardlex crystal, the deep-blue dial accentuates the light-catching, LumiBrite hands and hour markers, and is bordered by a two-tone, blue and red stainless-steel, rotating bezel with markers to measure elapsed time. This sophisticated timepiece also sports a window at 3 o'clock that displays both the date and day. As resilient as it is sophisticated, this analog watch is driven by an automatic movement that is powered by the motion of your wrist, and is water resistant down to 660 feet.































"
2296,"With a bold design, this Invicta chronograph has a poised and calm ambience that’s sure to have you looking twice.

This Invicta Maco Swiss Pro Diver watch exhibits a handsome styling that belies its rugged utility. The shock-resistant stainless-steel, 43-millimeter round case boasts a unidirectional black bezel that measures elapsed time up to an hour. Protected by an anti-reflective, hard mineral crystal with magnifier, the jet-black dial features Trinite luminous white hands and hour markers, and a date window in the 3 o'clock position. This timepiece is showcased on a stainless-steel, 20-millimeter band with a polished-silver finish, and a diver buckle with safety clasp. Simply elegant and supremely resilient, this analog watch is driven by a Swiss quartz movement, and is water resistant to a depth of 660 feet.

Pro Diver Collection

Plunge into any horizon using the steadfast guidance of the Invicta Pro Diver. Stylishly classic, internal workings are forged with variations of either Swiss chronograph or 21-jewel automatic movements and willingly navigate in depths up to 300 meters. Built with confident prowess, the fortitude with which these timepieces function makes the Pro Diver the quintessential in performance.

Screw Down Crowns: Many Invicta watches are equipped with a screw down crown to help prevent water infiltration. This is most common on our Diver models. In order to adjust the date and/or time on such a watch, you must first unscrew the crown before you can gently pull it out to its first or second click stop position. To do this, simply rotate the crown counterclockwise until it springs open. When you have finished setting the watch, the crown must then be pushed in and screwed back in tightly. Not doing so will cancel the water resistance of the watch and will void all warranties from the manufacturer. Overall, this process should not require a lot of effort or force.

Founder Jeff Kelley was disappointed to see little selection in a category of footwear that had become his main shoe staple: the flip flop. Jeff had always been interested in footwear and with a little help from a few friends Sanuk was born. Years later, the Sanuk brand still delivers out of the ordinary, quality product to surf and specialty shops every season and has helped bring the flip-flop category from a summer only item to something worn all year.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

2384,"This simple artistic symbol of family love makes a great gift and a powerful statement that is sure to warm the heart of any mother - no matter the age of her children. Measuring approximately 1 inch L x 1/2 inch W, this original Loving Family pendant depicts a loving mother and one child whose touching embrace forms a heart. A silver matte finish center adds dimension in contrast to the polished finish of the outer part of the pendant. Pendant is crafted from .925 sterling silver and finished with a tarnish-resistant coating. A sentimental favorite, this pendant comes ready to wear on a delicate 18 inch L sterling silver box chain with spring ring clasp. Pendant also looks great on a snake chain such as B00062BISU (purchased separately), for those who prefer a heavier looking chain. Our jewelry is proudly made in America with US and imported parts. We do our part for the environment by crafting our jewelry from recycled .925 sterling silver. Loving Family gift box is made in China. *Note: The white silver matte finish in the center of each .925 sterling silver Loving Family pendant is created by sandblasting the inside of the pendant and then applying a silver finish to that area to create a dimensional look. Minute quantities of different metals can be utilized in the liquid bath to facilitate the bonding of both the silver finish and the protective clear plastic resin anti-tarnish e-coat finish to the surface of the .925 sterling silver Loving Family piece. These metals do not include nickel or any other ferromagnetic materials. We invite you to contact us with any questions or concerns that you may have regarding any of our Loving Family products.

2407,"Proper care of pearls is not difficult if you remember that they are organic and produced by a living thing. Pearls are soft and delicate, but when cared for with common sense, they will maintain their lustre for centuries. The pearls should not come in contact with cosmetics, hairspray, perfume, chlorinated water, or other harsh chemicals. To keep them clean, let them be the last item put on when dressing, and the first item taken off at the end of an evening. The best way to maintain their lustre is to wear the pearls often, and wipe them down with a soft cloth afterward--pearls absorb the oils from skin, which helps keep them moist. Pearls should be stored in a cloth pouch or jewelry bag, separated from other jewelry to prevent nicks or chipping. Periodically, pearl strands should be restrung since the silk thread used to tie the pearls together breaks down over time.

These classic pearl stud earrings feature Akoya saltwater cultured pearls. They are set on 14k yellow gold posts and include push back closures. Akoya cultured pearls are known for their deep luster and lovely color. The pearls in these earrings have a fine white/rose color. They can be expected to range between 6.5 and 7 mm, have excellent luster, and few visible blemishes or marks. Pearl stud earrings are an essential part of any fine jewelry wardrobe. They are one of the most versatile pieces a woman can own--understated enough for everyday, sophisticated and refined in a professional setting, and shimmering and elegant for evenings.

In 1804, T. & A. Evans (Thomas and Amos) were running a small shoe business connected with a general store in the town of South Reading. There was no shoe factory as we know it today, just a small shop where Thomas and Amos cut the leather for their shoes. The actual shoe making was farmed out among the people of the town, while Thomas and Amos supplied them with uppers, soles, counters and heels to be assembled into shoes. All shoes were sewed by hand whenever the shoemaker-farmers could spare the time. Today L.B. Evans is owned and operated as a division of Daniel Green Enterprises. Many of the traditional gentleman's slipper styles are still part of the line, but the business has grown to include new updated classics, premium products including elk and deer, and an array or rugged, warm outdoor styles. Daniel Green Enterprises remains committed to the quality and comfort guarantee that the Evans brothers established over 200 years ago.

The hairs are gathered from the Himalayan goat called Hircus, which lives at high altitudes, 12 to 14000 feet in the mountains. The Pashmina is gathered by hand, stored and combed by nomadic herders. The threads are hand woven on hand looms over a silk wrap, which gives the fabric resilience. Once the fabric is loomed, each piece is hand dyed in open vats. Afterwards it is given to the different craftsmen for hand-embroidery, beading and /or printing. They are very soft and luxurious in feel. These shawls are woven from the best quality of Pashmina Wool and Silk. These shawls can be worn as a wrap or a scarf. The size is 80 inches long and 36 inches wide and each shawl is finished with 2 or 2.5 inches long tassels. The fabric comprises of approximately 70% Pashmina Wool and 30% Silk . The combination of pashmina wool and silk makes the fabric versatile and resonating with color. The shawls are hand loomed in Nepal and India and are offered in a wide selection of vibrant colors.

There is a warm westerly breeze rustling the palms, the lulling roar of crashing waves - it's a celebration of island living, courtesy of Tony Margolis, Bob Emfield and Lucio Dalla Gasperina. In 1992, our fictional Tommy Bahama character became the inspiration behind the experience of traveling to exotic locales where the food is good, the beaches are hot and the mood is relaxed.

Tommy Bahama and his tropical adventures command the finer things in life: casual, comfortable sportswear, golf wear, wimwear, footwear and accessories for men and women. As the purveyor of island lifestyles, Tommy Bahama, has created a world where life moves at a more relaxed pace, where the enjoyment of the good life is the norm, rather than the exception.

THE GARDEN OF HOPE AND COURAGE
The principals behind Tommy Bahama are committed to extending the relaxed, positive vibe of the brand into philanthropic efforts. The company's participation in the Garden of Hope and Courage is an example of this commitment.

The wife of one of the founders of Tommy Bahama, Janet Emfield, battled breast cancer. During her struggle, she envisioned a peaceful garden in the midst of a sterile hospital setting  a place of tranquility and solace for cancer patients, their families and health care providers. As an avid gardener, Emfield recognized the physical and psychological healing benefits that a natural garden setting could provide. The Garden of Hope and Courage is dedicated to bringing the healing power of gardens to hospitals across the country.

The organization has several goals in addition to paying tribute to those who have fought against breast cancer: to increase public awareness of the disease, to provide current information about early detection and treatment, and to raise money for breast cancer research.

Baffin combines leading molding technology with a foam-based inner boot system, which creates a hybrid style of high-performance footwear. This equates to more warmth, better fit, and superior comfort. Baffin boots are different than most shoes and work boots because the sole and midsole are molded to the base in one continuous process. The sole itself is a marvel of modern engineering because it is made up of several advanced thermo-set polymers that are combined together to achieve the right balance of warmth, protection, low weight and grip.

The Lopez 50 shoe is a skate shoe designed by Adrian Lopez utilizing components such as genuine vulcanized construction, a triple stitch toe cap, and a custom C1RCA outsole tread pattern. Elastic tongue straps offer up a comfortable fit and extended sizes up to 15 are available.

C1RCA is an independent lifestyle brand, rooted in skateboarding, influenced by music, art and culture. C1RCA is committed to creating quality and innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories.

Introduced in 1999, the C1RCA name was developed to express timelessness and a feeling of non-restriction, much like the logo itself. The logo origin was born out of the development of the C1RCA tread, a performance-based surface developed with skateboarding in mind. And since the circle represents a realm of action or influence, it was fitting to work with that in mind for the overall brand icon. From there, the center circle was then housed between two C’s, representing C1RCA and its commitment to function, fashion and sport.

Diamond Clarity:

No two diamonds are alike. A diamond's most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler's magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond's clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond's clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.



Diamond Color:

Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.



Diamond Carat Weight:

A diamond's weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.



Diamond Certification:

A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.

Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.

Our Diamond Policy:

Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world's largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.

Diamond Care:

Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

Founded by Mel Bernie in 1968, the 1928 Jewelry Company specializes in classic designed fashion jewelry, gifts, accessories, and antique reproduction jewelry. The name ""1928"" originated from Mel's desire to create reproductions inspired by beautiful antique jewelry. It was while looking through fashion magazines that Mel saw an article entitled, ""This is the year of 1928.""

Each and every 1928 design uses time-honored methods of making jewelry, from the setting of stones to hand enameling. This process guarantees the quality of the 1928 jewelry product. Designers at 1928 shop antique stores and estate sales for original pieces and consult reference libraries and museums for the history of the design.

Since its inception, the company has diversified and grown by successfully extending the 1928 brand into several other labels and categories. In addition to the core foundation of 1928 jewelry, the company also designs and sells under specialty brands like: 2028 a Macy's exclusive, 1928 Boutique, The Vatican Library Collection, Antiquities Couture, and 1928 Hair Jewelry.

The 1928 Jewelry Company is privately owned and family managed. An atmosphere of pride and creativity at every level contributes to 1928's continued success. A company born out of inspirations from the past is now in its fourth decade of jewelry production.

Diamond Clarity:

No two diamonds are alike. A diamond's most distinguishing characteristics are its inclusions, marks that are often invisible to the naked eye. However, under a jeweler's magnifying loupe or microscope they can look like crystals, tiny rivers, or clouds. A diamond's clarity is determined by the presence or absence of inclusions--fewer inclusions mean better clarity--and how visible they are. The greater a diamond's clarity, the greater its brilliance and value. A diamond categorized as internally flawless will have no inclusions, but this is extremely rare.



Diamond Color:

Though diamonds come in a wide range of colors, colorless diamonds have traditionally been considered the most valuable. Most diamonds are graded on a scale using the letters of the alphabet, from D (colorless), the best grade, through Z (a light yellow). It is difficult for the untrained eye to notice such variations in color unless stones are being compared side by side.



Diamond Carat Weight:

A diamond's weight is measured in carats, with one carat being equivalent to 100 points. You will often see a diamond referred to as a 3/4-carat stone or a 75-point diamond. Larger stones are often more highly valued, but size should not be the only consideration--high brilliance, which varies according to clarity, cut, and color grade, is highly desirable in a diamond.



Diamond Certification:

A diamond certificate represents independent verification that the stone purchased has all the qualities of cut, color, clarity, shape, and weight expected. It is a further indication of the condition and value of that diamond as represented on our site. Such certificates are issued by several agencies employing highly trained gemologists and provide an unbiased and accurate evaluation of the diamond. These gemologists scrutinize each stone to analyze its dimensions, clarity, cut, color, finish, symmetry, and other details.

Diamonds purchased from the Amazon.com Collection may be certified by the Gemological Institute of America or the International Gemological Institute. The type of certificate provided will be noted in the product specifications of your jewelry purchase; if you do not see a certificate type noted, one will not be provided.

Our Diamond Policy:

Amazon.com sources high-quality diamonds from some of the world's largest suppliers. All our diamond suppliers certify that to their best knowledge their diamonds are not conflict diamonds.

Diamond Care:

Diamonds, as the hardest substance on earth, are resistant to damage. However, diamond jewelry is set in different metals, and care will vary from piece to piece. Diamonds should be cleaned in a solution of one part ammonia to six parts water, using a gentle scrubbing brush to remove any dirt. It is a good idea to have them cleaned once a year by a professional jeweler, at which time the security of the setting can be checked as well. Diamond jewelry should be stored in a soft cloth pouch to ensure that the stone will not scratch other jewelry.

Freshwater Cultured Pearls

These pearls are gathered from freshwater lake and river mollusks. Most Freshwater pearls come from China and they can be mostly round to off-round, or rice-shaped to baroque. They look similar to Akoya pearls, but are the perfect gift when on a budget. They might be slightly less symmetrical, smaller, or not as easily matched, but these minor differences provide a major value for the price.

Cultivation

Pearls are produced naturally in the body of salt and freshwater mollusks, such as oysters and mussels. When these animals sense an irritant, such as a grain of sand, they produce a soft coating of calcium carbonate substance around it. The result is a pearl. Because perfectly round, naturally produced pearls are so rare, a process known as cultivation was developed by Kokichi Mikimoto in the early 1900s. A small bead of polished shell, the nucleus, is used as an irritant and delicately inserted into the mantle of a mollusk. It takes approximately 20-24 months of intensive husbandry to cultivate a saltwater pearl and somewhat less time to cultivate freshwater pearls. The harvest usually takes place during the months of June and September.

Color

Mollusks produce pearls in a variety of colors, accommodating most personal preferences and budgets. The general color of a pearl is also known as the body color. Pearls typically range from white, cream, and yellow to pink, silver, or black. An overtone of secondary color is sometimes seen. For instance, a pearl may appear to be white, but upon closer inspection a rosy hue is detected. The body color would then be termed white-rosé. Color variation does not affect the quality of the pearl, though it should be noted that color matching is important when choosing pearls for some necklaces, earrings, or bracelets. In fashion jewelry, pearls can sometimes be dyed to achieve the desired color, which should be mentioned in the product description or specifications.

Lustre

The appealing, deep shine of a pearl is often what defines its beauty. This shine is produced by multiple layers of semi-opaque calcium carbonate crystals, called nacre. The nacre reflects light on the surface of the pearl, producing brilliance and sheen. Lustre is an integral feature in determining the quality of a pearl. Large pearls have a thicker nacre and, therefore, a higher lustre. When comparing a small Freshwater pearl to a large South Sea pearl, the difference is clearly visible to the untrained eye and should be considered when purchasing pearls.

Shape

While pearls come in many different shapes, the rarest and highest-quality are round. Akoya, Tahitian, and South Sea oysters tend to produce the roundest pearls, while those of Freshwater mollusks can be oval to slightly off-round. When considering a pearl purchase, whether it be a necklace, bracelet, or earrings, look for consistency in the shapes of the pearls. Many of the less symmetrical shapes are used in stylish jewelry which can be quite beautiful: the drop pearl's shape lends well to earrings, and the baroque pearl features irregular shapes that work well as necklace accents. In addition, a half sphere pearl called a ""mabe"" is often used in earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.

Size

An oyster's particular type and size has a direct effect on how large the pearl it produces will be, and pearls do come in a wide range of sizes. Round pearls are measured according to their diameter, while baroque pearls are measured by their length and width. A pearl's size does not necessarily affect its quality, but it does affect its price. Large, round pearls are rare and their lustre is usually high--this beautiful combination of traits is often reflected in the cost of such pearls.





























Surface Markings

Often when an oyster creates a pearl, the nacre does not develop smoothly. The surface of a pearl is judged by how many marks are visible in the nacre. These imperfections can be small and unnoticeable or quite large and distinct. Like diamonds, pearls are rarely flawless. However, high lustre or the way pearls are strung and set can help conceal surface markings.

Care

Proper care of pearls is not difficult if you remember that they are organic and produced by a living thing. Pearls are soft and delicate, but when cared for with common sense, they will maintain their lustre for centuries. The pearls should not come in contact with cosmetics, hairspray, perfume, chlorinated water, or other harsh chemicals. To keep them clean, let them be the last item put on when dressing, and the first item taken off at the end of an evening. The best way to maintain their lustre is to wear the pearls often, and wipe them down with a soft cloth afterward--pearls absorb the oils from skin, which helps keep them moist. Pearls should be stored in a cloth pouch or jewelry bag, separated from other jewelry to prevent nicks or chipping. Periodically, pearl strands should be restrung since the silk thread used to tie the pearls together breaks down over time.

Freshwater Cultured Pearls

These pearls are gathered from freshwater lake and river mollusks. Most Freshwater pearls come from China and they can be mostly round to off-round, or rice-shaped to baroque. They look similar to Akoya pearls, but are the perfect gift when on a budget. They might be slightly less symmetrical, smaller, or not as easily matched, but these minor differences provide a major value for the price.

Sterling Silver History

Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow. During this craze, companies began to experiment using sterling silver compositions in jewelry, as it was a material that was easy to mold into intricate designs and gave a luxurious look with its metallic finish. Today, sterling silver is widely used in all kinds of jewelry styles and shines as beautifully as other precious metals, with the benefit of affordable pricing.

Sterling Silver Composition

While pure silver can be combined with many different types of metals, sterling silver is created when combining pure silver with copper. Sterling silver jewelry can be composed with different amounts of copper but is most often seen with the .925 stamp, meaning that the composition is of 92.5 percent silver and 7.5 percent copper. This has been found to be a good combination for maintaining the silver's durability without harming its sparkle.

Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry

Silver should not come into contact with harsh household chemicals such as bleach, ammonia, or chlorine. To avoid scratches, store silver in a lined jewelry box or pouch, as it is prone to tarnish as it naturally reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the air. Cleaning and wearing silver jewelry regularly will prevent this and help maintain its shine. Immediately upon noticing any discoloration, use a gentle polish made specifically for removing tarnish.

In 1875, a young Czech immigrant named Joseph Bulova set up shop in New York City, and a legendary American watch brand was born. Bulova was trained as a jeweler, and his expertise carried over into his watchmaking career, which began around 1911 with boudoir clocks and pocket watches, and soon evolved to include what was then one of the latest and most fashionable technological innovations: the wristwatch.

Bulova introduced its first line of wristwatches in 1919. The company grew and prospered, and soon early radio and television ads were declaring, ""America runs on Bulova time."" In the 1950s, continuing its legacy of innovation, Bulova introduced Accutron, the first electronic watch, and the first breakthrough in timekeeping technology in over 300 years. The Accutron timing mechanism was later adapted for use by NASA computers and a Bulova timer was even placed on the moon to control transmissions of data. Bulova timepieces have kept official time aboard Air Force One and have also served as official timepieces for U.S. Olympic teams.

Today, Bulova maintains its tradition of excellence in technology and design, offering a diverse collection of beautiful precision timepieces for every occasion.
